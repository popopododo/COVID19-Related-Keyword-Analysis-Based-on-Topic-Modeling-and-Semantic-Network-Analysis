       " 'text': ['Pregnant women are being turned away from Covid vaccine clinics despite clinical advice, experts have warned as they urged ministers to ramp up efforts to reach unvaccinated groups.\\nMembers of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) told the Guardian that efforts to increase booster jab uptake will not be sufficient to prevent more deaths and hospitalisations, and that ministers must prioritise reaching those who have had no jabs. In particular they urged a focus on pregnant women as only about 15% in the UK have been fully vaccinated. Among all over-12s, the figure is 79%.\\nOn Tuesday the NHS said pregnant women should never be turned away from clinics and said vaccines could save the lives of women and their babies.\\nNew data from Oxford University’s MBRRACE-UK study on maternal health, seen by the Guardian, shows that at least 13 pregnant women died with Covid between July and September this year, with 85% of them believed to have been unvaccinated. The figure is higher than in the first and second waves of the pandemic, when nine and 11 pregnant women died but when jabs were not available.\\nProf Marian Knight, the lead for the MBRRACE-UK programme, said there was still no joined-up messaging across the health service. “Women are being turned away from clinics and now there are some trusts offering it as part of the maternity service, but it is not universal so there are still barriers,” she said.\\n“It is important we start to see data on outcomes in vaccinated women so we can show evidence that vaccines are safe, rather than say there’s no evidence they cause harm. These are very small numbers, but the point is that women could have been saved; children have been orphaned.”\\nJoeli Brearley, the founder of the charity Pregnant Then Screwed, said old leaflets advising against the jab were still in circulation at some healthcare centres. Some professionals were giving conflicting advice on safety, with hesitancy also driven by the fact that pregnant women were not yet included in the booster jab drive, she added. “It sends out the message: we are not sure about pregnant women and the vaccination.”\\nCovid in pregnancy is linked to a raised risk of premature delivery, while pregnant women are more likely to become seriously ill than non-pregnant women of the same age. A previous study found that one in six of 118 Covid patients requiring the most intensive ventilation treatment were unvaccinated pregnant women.\\nOther research suggests the Delta variant poses a greater threat to pregnant women than previous variants. In July the UK Obstetric Surveillance System found that one in four pregnant women admitted to hospital with Covid in the first wave had moderate to severe disease compared with 45% of recent admissions. Between March and July, one in three pregnant women in hospital with Covid required respiratory support, and one in seven required intensive care.\\nPregnant women are among those that some members of the JCVI, which advises the government on vaccine policy, are most concerned about. However, some scientists have privately accused the JCVI itself of being slow to advise that the vaccine was safe for pregnant women.\\nAn NHS spokesperson said: “Pregnant women should not be turned away from NHS vaccination centres and women should continue to come forward for the lifesaving Covid vaccine – they can make a booking through the national booking service online or by calling 119 anytime between 7am and 11pm seven days a week.\\n“The NHS has advised midwifery staff to give pregnant women the information they need to make the right decision for them and their baby so if you are pregnant and have any concerns, please come forward and discuss them with a healthcare professional.”\\nAdam Finn, a professor of paediatrics at the University of Bristol and a member of the JCVI, said: “It does now seem clear that not only does Covid in pregnancy bring an increased risk of premature delivery but also pregnant women are more likely to get seriously ill than non-pregnant women of the same age. So there’s a need to communicate that effectively and that can probably most effectively be done by midwives.\\n“The people who benefit most from vaccines, whether or not they are pregnant, are those who have had no doses so far. Explaining to people why this makes sense and is important for them is, perhaps, the most worthwhile thing we could be doing at present.”\\nAnother member of the JCVI, Dr Maggie Wearmouth, said: “The message is just not reaching many pregnant women … Saving lives and reducing admissions needs more active outreach to the 4 million people not yet vaccinated at all, particularly pregnant women and young black men.”\\nWhy pregnant women need clearer messaging on Covid vaccine safety\\nRead more\\nAmid criticism of the pace of the booster rollout, the government has pledged to intensify efforts to improve take-up of the third jab offered to those over 50 and the clinically vulnerable. Last week, government sources said they would examine whether to cut the period that must elapse before a booster jab from six months to five.\\nMembers of the JCVI are understood to be sceptical about the effects of such a move. Finn said: “Getting the booster programme done as quickly as possible is only one aspect of a complex situation.\\n“It’s important to immunise the right people – those who actually need a booster – at the right time, when their response to it will be substantial and as long-lasting as possible. It’s also important not to overestimate what the booster programme is capable of – after all it is simply increasing the level of protection against serious illness in people whose protection from the first two doses is still pretty good.\\n“Finally, the booster programme will not do much to reduce the circulation of the virus more generally or any time soon – other precautions would be needed to achieve that.”\\nWearmouth said it was highly unlikely there would be any clinical benefit to speeding up the booster jabs. “The sooner a booster is given, the sooner it may have to be given yet again,” she said. “We are clearly losing the battle by depending on vaccinations alone. It is time for a serious review of wider aspects. We need politicians and known faces to be seen to have their boosters as well as observing social distancing, masks, etc.”\\nProf Anthony Harnden, deputy chairman of the JCVI, told Sky News: “Vaccines do a lot of the heavy lifting, but they can’t do everything, so social distancing, mask wearing in crowded spaces and being sensible is all part of what we ought to be doing as a society.”\\nThis article was amended on 27 October 2021 to include Dr Maggie Wearmouth’s title.',\n",

       "  'Almost 1,000 Covid vaccination providers are destroying expired AstraZeneca supplies, with the wastage of 31,833 doses reported despite Australian production of the vaccine continuing at near-record rates.\\nThere are now fears more will be binned as rates of uptake wane due to increased vaccination choice and the federal health department stepping in to manage the overstock.\\nData given to Guardian Australia shows a relatively low rate of wastage of AstraZeneca due to expiry so far, though there are fears of a looming glut of the vaccine as uptake shifts increasingly to Pfizer.\\nThe federal health department data showed 969 sites, less than 10% of the total number of vaccine providers, reported having to waste expired AstraZeneca. About 822 of those sites said they destroyed less than five vials.\\nAbout 32,000 doses have been reported as expired by vaccine providers, a fraction of the 24m doses made available since the beginning of the rollout.\\nBut the latest data also shows a huge volume of unused AstraZeneca in Australia, which has grown to more than 7m doses, as local production continues apace.\\nDomestic production allowed 2.5m doses to be released for use in July. That increased to 4m in August and 3.9m in September.\\nThe use of AstraZeneca, however, has waned. There were 2m doses administered in September, down from 3m in August.\\nAstraZeneca has a shelf life of six months, according to the Therapeutic Goods Administration, meaning any wastage from the current stockpile is not likely to be imminent.\\nThe health department is starting to take steps to avoid wastage of AstraZeneca. It recently wrote to GP clinics and pharmacies to advise them on how to manage their excess doses.\\nThe advice included transferring surplus stock to local administration sites that have greater demand. The department said it was also “working with vaccination providers to assist with redirection of excess stock where practical,” a spokesperson said.\\nStock is also being collected for donations to Pacific neighbours through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.\\nAustralia has so far donated about 3.7m doses to 12 countries in the Pacific.\\nBut the government has been urged to do more.\\nThe campaign group End Covid For All recently called on Australia to donate 20m extra vaccines to help lower-income countries combat Covid-19, using the Covax facility. It also called on the government to invest an extra $250m in Covax.\\nWriting for the Lowy Institute’s Interpreter earlier this month, Labor MP Josh Burns said spare locally made AstraZeneca vaccines should be given to Indonesia.\\n“Indonesia has a vacuum of need for vaccines that is predominantly being filled by China, and yet Australia happens to have millions of spare doses that could save thousands of Indonesian lives,” he wrote. “In these circumstances, it is in Australia’s interest to be confident and generous in the Indo-Pacific.”\\n“Australia’s first priority with vaccination aid was to support the Pacific. Yet the Pacific’s supply is now guaranteed, and Australia still has surplus doses.”\\nThe latest data shows a recent drop-off in the number of AstraZeneca doses set aside for donations to the Pacific, despite the flagging domestic demand.\\nReports from the vaccine operations centre show the volume of doses made available for distribution to the Pacific fell to just 26,500 last week, down from 308,000 and 200,000 in the two weeks prior, and weekly totals of 500,000 through much of September.',\n",
       "  'Independent advisers for the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Tuesday recommended the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid vaccine for children aged five to 11 – the first vaccine available for younger children in the US.\\nOf 18 members, 17 voted yes and one abstained.\\nVaccines for children have been seen as crucial for protecting kids from the virus as well as slowing its spread, in addition to reducing the social and educational effects of school closing and attendance – and related economic concerns, such as caregivers’ ability to work.\\nThe advisers weighed the vaccine’s effectiveness, the social and physical effects of the pandemic, and the potential risk of rare side-effects like myocarditis, a type of heart inflammation.\\nData from Pfizer-BioNTech indicate the vaccine is 90.7% effective at preventing symptomatic illness among this age group.\\nThe benefits of vaccination “clearly outweigh” the risks of myocarditis and pericarditis, FDA scientists concluded in an analysis, an assessment the independent advisers agreed with.\\nMaking these decisions can be difficult and nerve-racking, but they are not made “when you know everything”, said Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. “The question is when do you know enough.” In this case, he said, the benefits outweigh the risks, especially since myocarditis tends to be less common in pre-adolescent children.\\n“Our kids are going to be dealing with this virus for many years to come,” said Jay Portnoy, professor of pediatrics at the University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Medicine. “Getting the vaccine is just the first step that they’re going to take towards being able to protect themselves.”\\nPeter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), highlighted the harms of the pandemic.\\n“Far from being spared from this harm of Covid-19, in the five-to-11 year-old age range, there have been over 1.9m infections, over 8,300 hospitalizations (about a third of which have required intensive care unit stays), and over 2,500 cases of multisystem inflammatory disorder from Covid-19,” Marks said.\\nNearly 100 children in this age group have died, making it the eighth leading cause of death in the past year for this group. Children between five and 11 have one of the highest case rates of any age group, accounting for about one in 10 of all Covid cases in the country. They are also the most frequently affected by MIS-C, an inflammatory disorder that affects organs.\\nChildren are “at least as likely” to be infected as adults, said Fiona Havers, medical officer at the CDC. But at the same time, cases among kids are more likely to go unnoticed, according to seroprevalence data indicating that about 43% of children have already been infected.\\n“There are many other adverse outcomes on children from the pandemic, including worsening emotional and mental health, decreased physical activity and loss of caregivers,” Havers said. “Lost in-person learning is another potential adverse outcome of Covid-19.”\\nThe effects of the pandemic are unequal among children. Black, Hispanic and Native American children have a greater risk for developing MIS-C or dying from Covid-19.\\nSeveral advisers repeatedly pointed to the importance of vaccinating children in order to reduce cases throughout the country. While it is not yet clear how well the vaccine keeps children from transmitting the virus, data among vaccinated adults shows this is likely, and reducing the number of overall Covid cases through vaccination would help reduce spread.\\n“Children likely play an important role in transmission, and vaccinating children can help reach herd immunity,” said William Gruber, head of vaccination development at Pfizer.\\nThe Pfizer-BioNTech trial included 1,518 children who received the vaccine beginning in June, as well as an additional 1,591 children who were vaccinated beginning in August, when the FDA asked the company to expand the trial in order to pick up on safety concerns.\\nMild side-effects like fever and chills were less common among the kids than in older age groups. There were no reports of myocarditis among the approximately 3,100 children receiving the vaccine.\\nBut serious rare side-effects like myocarditis may be “the principal concern people have regarding use of these mRNA vaccines and in children,” said H Cody Meissner, professor of pediatrics at Tufts University School of Medicine.\\nMyocarditis cases after vaccination tend to happen within a week, generally among adolescent males, and boys between the ages of 16 and 17 have the highest rate, at 0.007%, said Matthew Oster, a medical officer for the CDC. “Testosterone and hormones play a big role in this, which is part of why you may see a really high peak in adolescence and young adulthood, especially among males,” Oster said.\\nThe FDA, in its scientific analysis, said the risks of Covid outweighed the risks of myocarditis. In one scenario that Hong Yang at the FDA called “purposefully conservative,” Covid cases could drop until more children are hospitalized from the vaccine than from the illness.\\n“If you just look at our track record in terms of predicting the epidemics, we’ve not done particularly well,” Pfizer’s Gruber said. “Given that the winter season is coming, the Delta [variant] is still up there, you still have a large number of susceptible children – there’s every reason to believe that the rate will not be at the nadir.”\\nArnold Monto, acting chair of the committee, warned against “assuming that we are on the descending slope of the curve. Thinking that this is going to be the end of the wave permanently is maybe a little overly optimistic.”\\nWhile cases in the US have dropped since their recent height in September, coming cold weather and holidays may bring another spike.\\nThe vaccine for this age group was formulated slightly differently, in order to extend its shelf life in a refrigerator from one month to 10 weeks, which should help the roll-out to pediatricians’ offices and elsewhere. The proposed dose for children is 10 micrograms, or one-third the adult dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The child-size doses look different from adult doses in order to prevent mix-ups, with caps and labels colored orange instead of purple.\\nChildren 12 and up currently receive a higher dose than those 11 and younger. But antibody titers were similar across all age groups in this trial, potentially indicating that a lower dose could be sufficient for older children, Pfizer’s Gruber said.\\nOn 2-3 November, advisers for the CDC will meet to discuss their recommendations as well. The FDA and the CDC will take the advisers’ recommendations into account when making the decision whether to authorize the vaccine.\\nWhile a little less than half of US children may already have some immunity after surviving Covid, it is not clear how well infection-acquired immunity will last, especially in the face of emerging variants. Reinfections are becoming more common across age groups, Havers said.',\n",
       "  'Australians could soon be able to access a Covid vaccine booster shot, after the drugs regulator provisionally approved Pfizer third doses for those who are 18 and over.\\nThe Therapeutic Goods Administration gave the manufacturer provisional approval on Wednesday, meaning Pfizer must continue clinical trials examining the efficacy of the booster shot, and to submit ongoing evidence from those trials for review by the regulator.\\nAustralia did a good job in the face of Covid. Let’s apply that energy to other public health problems\\nGideon Meyerowitz-Katz\\nRead more\\nThe decision follows the approval of a booster dose for severely immunocompromised people aged 12 years and over at least 28 days after the second dose. This group has been eligible to receive a booster dose of Pfizer since 11 October.\\nSo how do you get a booster shot and what difference do they make to your protection against Covid?\\nWhen can I get my third booster dose?\\nThe start of the rollout of booster shots for the general population could be only a couple of weeks away.\\nNow that the TGA has signed off (provisionally), the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation [Atagi] also needs to give its view. Atagi comprises independent medical and consumer experts who advise the government on how to make sure the rollout is equitable, evidence-based and safe.\\nThe health minister, Greg Hunt, said on Wednesday he expected Atagi’s final advice wouldn’t be far away and the government hoped the booster program would begin by 8 November.\\nHowever, just like the vaccine rollout, some groups will have priority.\\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\\n“We will commence aged care and disability as a priority,” Hunt said. This will begin “immediately” in Victoria, he said, which is still struggling with high case numbers. A consent process is being rolled out in aged care and disability facilities to fast track that, and the booster will then be administered by TLC Healthcare, which is helping Victorian aged care providers with the vaccine rollout. Atagi has already provided preliminary advice approving the booster for these groups.\\nThe TGA said booster shots must be given at least six months after the first two vaccine doses. For now, the government’s priority is making sure as many people as possible receive their first two doses of a Covid vaccine, because even after six months, the two-doses still provides protection against severe illness and hospitalisation. However, overall protection against Covid and breakthrough infections wane over time.\\nA strong study from Israel published in the New England Journal of Medicine in October found that among 1,137,804 people 60 years or older, those who had received a booster shot at least five months earlier had “substantially lower” rates of Covid-19 and severe illness compared to those in the same age group who had received two shots.\\nWhat brand of vaccine will I get for my booster?\\nCurrently, only Pfizer has been approved for use as a booster dose. While Australians must receive the same brand of vaccine for their first two doses other than in exceptional circumstances, the TGA says the booster Pfizer dose can be given no matter what brand of vaccine was given for the first two doses.\\nThe government expects that Moderna will also apply to the TGA for the registration and approval of booster doses. It is similar to the Pfizer vaccine. The TGA has also received part of an application from Pfizer to have its vaccine for use in children between the ages of five and 11 approved.\\nSee Australia’s state and territory Covid vaccination rollouts animated over time\\nRead more\\nThe head of the TGA, Prof John Skerritt, said by 1 January, about 1.6 million people will be six months or more from their second vaccine dose and eligible for a booster. He said there is “more than enough” Pfizer supply to cover them.\\nWill I need another booster shot after the third dose?\\nThe head of the molecular virology laboratory at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity at the University of Melbourne, Prof Damian Purcell, said it is too early to know.\\n“It’s going to need another six to eight months of monitoring the data internationally to see whether, again, the immunity diminishes,” Purcell said. “But there is some hope from animal studies that it’s going to provide a longer, more sustained boost. But we don’t know until enough people have had the third dose and we have been able to monitor them for more than six months.”\\nSkerritt agreed: “We’ll have to wait and see.”\\n“There are some vaccines [for other diseases] whereby three shots gives you almost lifelong protection,” he said. “No one knows about the duration of protection post this booster. The really good news is that a few months ago, we were worried we’d have to have quite different vaccines because of the emergence of variants. But even with the severity of Delta and how predominant Delta has been globally, we haven’t needed to change the vaccine or booster.”\\nHow will I know when I am due for my third dose?\\nIt is unclear whether state and territory run vaccination hubs are likely to send text messages and reminders about a third dose, as they currently do in some states for booking a second dose. Some GP clinics also send out text message reminders for second doses.\\nQuick Guide\\nHow to get the latest news from Guardian Australia\\nShow\\nThis detail is likely to be worked out once Atagi releases its advice and priority groups for boosters are finalised.\\nIt is unlikely to matter whether you receive the third dose from a GP or vaccination hub; currently, people can get their first two vaccine doses at different locations.\\nWill I need the third dose to be considered fully vaccinated?\\nWhether a third dose will be mandated will depend on employers, and rules in different jurisdictions.\\nOn Sunday, the Victorian premier Daniel Andrews said participating in the states “vaccinated economy” in future may “be about the maintenance of your vaccination status” through a booster shot.\\nHunt said at this stage a booster will not be mandatory for being able to travel overseas and return to Australia, or to be considered fully vaccinated by the federal government. But he said he encourages every Australian to get the booster once eligible.\\nBoosters will eventually be required to enter some other countries. Austria and Croatia have already put expiry dates on Covid vaccine certificates of 270 days, with a booster required for entry after that. Israel requires three doses before considering someone fully vaccinated. Other countries may follow.',\n",

       "  'GPs are being offered thousands of dollars in bribes to provide fake Covid vaccine certificates, while others have reported being abused and in some cases threatened by anti-vaxxers demanding doctored paperwork to overcome mandates.\\n“Lots of patients have [offered cash],” Dr Catherine Orr, a GP specialising in Covid-19 management in Melbourne, said.\\n“The state community health organisations have a collaborative, and $3,000 is the highest that as a collaborative we have been offered. For my individual clinic, I think the ‘best’ offer was $500. Clearly we refuse.”\\nThe issue of patients pressuring their GPs to provide illegitimate vaccine exemptions is so pervasive that the Medical Council of NSW has published an article with guidelines for medical practitioners, to make them aware of the strict criteria for exemptions.\\nMandatory vaccination for NSW essential workers is valid, court rules\\nRead more\\nThe president of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, Dr Karen Price, said misinformation about Covid-19 vaccines was leading some people to seek exemptions from their GP without medical grounds.\\n“This is a significant issue and it’s affecting GPs and practice teams across the country,” Price told Guardian Australia.\\n“There are some patients who are strongly against vaccination and heavily influenced by misinformation. Some patients are aggressive and abusive, demanding an exemption when not fitting the clear criteria. It is not just GPs, but our hard-working receptionists and other practice team members who’ve bore the brunt of this, and it does add to our stress levels.”\\nVictoria has one of the strictest vaccine mandates in the world, with the premier, Daniel Andrews, saying unvaccinated people without a genuine exemption will be barred from accessing most services until 2023. Once 90% of people age 16 and above are vaccinated, this mandate will also include children age 12 and above.\\nIn New South Wales, vaccination rules have applied for staff and customers aged 16 years and over since 11 October, when eligible businesses began to reopen. These rules will lift for unvaccinated people by 1 December.\\nHowever, there are certain industries and professions for which the states and territories have made vaccination compulsory to continue to work, and some businesses, such as Woolworths, Coles, Aldi, Qantas, BHP and others, are also mandating vaccinations for staff.\\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\\nSign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\\nPrice said when patients approached their doctor seeking an exemption, doctors tried to find out what their concerns were and explain the benefits of vaccination.\\n“I’ve heard numerous stories of GPs who’ve had frank discussions with hesitant patients and have allayed their fears by providing evidence-based information, and they’ve gone on to receive the vaccine,” she said.\\n“That takes courage and we thank those people for listening with an open mind.”\\nThe Medical Council’s president, Dr John Sammut, said: “A Covid-19 vaccination exemption is strictly limited and must be related to a health contraindication, for which evidence is required, to ensure a doctor is satisfied and can appropriately sign an exemption.”\\nA NSW doctor who signs a Covid-19 vaccination exemption for a patient who is not eligible faces the risk of regulatory action.\\nQuick Guide\\nHow to get the latest news from Guardian Australia\\nShow\\nThere are few circumstances in which an exemption can be provided. Exemptions can only be issued by a doctor if the patient meets a specific health contraindication included in the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation clinical guidance. In order to be permanently exempted from the vaccination, a patient must have medical contraindications to all three available vaccine brands in Australia.\\nThe president of the NSW branch of the Australian Medical Association, Dr Danielle McMullen, is a GP working in Sydney and said that very few people were actually vaccine-deniers. Most people who were unsure simply had questions and needed reassurance, she said.\\n“My patients know that I am very pro-vaccine, and so it’s quite rewarding when they still feel comfortable sharing their worries and asking questions,” she said. “There is also a group of people who thought they couldn’t get any vaccine because they’d had an anaphylaxis reaction to something else before. So we talk patients through all of that.”\\nA GP working in Queensland, who did not want to be named, said the few people that believed ‘Covid isn’t real’, or that the vaccine is ‘experimental gene therapy’ “can’t really be reasoned with”.\\n“I think the best approach with those patients is to explain the strict exemption criteria and that they don’t qualify and leave it at that,” they said.\\n“GPs should be aware that doctors have been reporting GPs to AHPRA [the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency] for providing exemptions against guidelines, so any GP giving an exemption in order to get a difficult or abusive patient out of their office is taking a big risk professionally.”',\n",
       "  'E\\nxciting news for people who believe in science enough to want mass vaccination, but not enough to think horoscopes are made up: Utah’s Salt Lake county health department says there’s a big difference in vaccination rates depending on your Zodiac sign.\\nAt least, that’s what officials found when they analysed anonymised data on 1.2million residents, providing a table of the least and most vaccinated star signs.\\nThe results showed that Leos – apparently the most compassionate – were the most vaccinated, at 70%, closely followed by people with the Aquarius sign (67%). Scorpios (the most evil star sign, clearly) came last – only 46% were vaccinated, with Virgos (50%) coming in a close second-to-last.\\nBut is that the whiff of truth you can smell or just someone who is too into horoscopes burning sage?\\nScope of the data\\nThere are a number of ways this study may say less about the generous nature of Leos, and more about the importance of even distributions.\\nThe head of data and visuals at Guardian US, Alvin Chang. breaks it down:\\n“To figure out what percentage of people of each sign are vaccinated, the county had to find two numbers:\\nHow many people of each Zodiac sign are vaccinated: Salt Lake county did this using anonymized state data. That’s likely quite accurate.\\nHow many people of each Zodiac sign live in the county overall: They estimated this by looking at the nationwide distribution of Zodiac signs, using data from the University of Texas-Austin. Then they assumed their county would have a similar distribution.\\nBut the distribution of when people are born can vary from state to state, and even more from county to county.”\\nThis all becomes clearer after looking at another table, the one showing how common each Zodiac sign in America is.\\nThis table is a near-exact inverse of the vaccination one. So, while Scorpios came last in Salt Lake’s table for vaccination, they are also the most commonly represented star sign in the US population (Americans like to procreate around the holiday period, it seems). The opposite was true for Leos and Aquariuses – the least common Zodiac signs in the US population, but the highest up in the vaccination table.\\n“It’s likely that Salt Lake county’s Zodiac sign distribution is a lot more even than it is nationwide,” Alvin says. “That’s probably why Leos – one of the least common signs – have the highest rates of vaccination; the county is probably undercounting the number of Leos there.”\\nAstrology is ‘not super-scientific’\\nWhen the Guardian spoke to Salt Lake City Health officials, they were candid about the limits of their research.\\nFrom a pandemic to plastic surgery: how Covid changed the way we see our faces\\nRead more\\n“Obviously, it’s not super scientific because we are talking astrology,” Nicholas Rupp, a Salt Lake health department spokesperson, said – to the dismay of horoscope fans everywhere.\\n“We did the math really quickly,” said Rupp, who claims the idea for the study came about after someone from the informatics department joked about analysing vaccination rates by star sign.\\n“We thought, we can we can use this to continue the conversation around vaccination, when there’s so much message fatigue on the topic. People are tired of hearing about it. So [we said] let’s put a new spin on it,” he says.\\nRupp, who didn’t know much about star signs before now, said the tweet had certainly got people talking.\\n“I’m hearing it’s not surprising that Scorpios are at the bottom because they tend to be distrustful. They tend to be very private,” he said, adding: “I’m learning all about astrology, and it’s been really fun.”\\nHe has also had some pushback. Some hardcore horoscope fans have chided him for analysing data by Sun signs instead of Moon signs.\\n“I want to thank the Leos and congratulate them for being at the top;they always knew they belonged to be there. They deserve to be there, and they’re proving it,” Rupp said. “But I also don’t want the Leos to rest on their laurels: 70% is not 100%.”\\n“To the Scorpios, I really want to tell them that their key to being in control and continuing their dominance of sort of the darker side of the zodiac is in being able to be out and influential. And vaccination is key to that influence,” he said.',\n",

There’s so many variables to economic activity right now, time will tell us whether Victoria or NSW will have the most economically successful approach.”\\nVictorian head of employer association Ai Group, Tim Piper, said his members welcomed vaccination mandates as a safeguard for businesses, but a uniform approach would make “everything we do in life easier”.\\n“Not having one [uniform approach] could cause problems for those coming in from overseas, who might be vaccinated but have differing quarantine requirements when they move between states,” he said.\\n“People are going to have difficulty living normal life without being vaccinated, and I think getting the vaccine will be an inevitable conclusion they come to.

If there’s a positive case, the unvaccinated will only be allowed to leave home for five essential reasons, while the vaccinated will be able to remain active in the community provided they wear a mask.\\nThere will be allowances made for people who cannot get vaccinated – like children under 12, and people who aren’t able to be vaccinated because they have evidence of a contraindication to all available vaccinations.\\nTasmania\\nWhen Tasmania reopens to the rest of Australia at 90% fully vaccinated, expected about 15 December, interstate travellers over 12 will only be able to visit the state if they are fully vaccinated and receive a negative test within 72 hours of travel.\\nPeople who travel to Tasmania and don’t meet the criteria will be “subject to additional quarantine and testing requirements” unless they have a legitimate exemption.\\nThe vaccine is currently mandatory for workers in healthcare settings and people who provide health and medical services in public and private hospitals.\\nSouth Australia\\nUnder South Australia’s Covid-19 roadmap, border restrictions with the ACT, NSW and Victoria will ease on 23 November, however only for the fully vaccinated.\\nQuarantine requirements for international travellers will be removed once the state reaches 90% double-vaccination targets, expected to occur around Christmas.

Elsewhere, it was a family-size bucket of KFC for those peckish after a lunchtime inoculation, or across the country, the offer of a boxful of “popcorn chicken” nuggets.\\nSo deep runs New Zealanders’ apparent love of fast food that the government has been in talks to send vaccination buses to offer shots at drive-through takeout queues.

Other locations provided king-size blocks of chocolate, supermarket vouchers or gelato.\\nSeveral vaccine clinics are also offering low sensory rooms, to make the experience a better one for those with autism, intellectual disabilities or sensory processing disorders.

So if you are someone with chronic health conditions, what might be a mild disease or mild infection in a young person or a person who is in good health, will have a greater impact on you.”\\nShe said this was why the Australian Technical Advisory Group for Immunisation (Atagi) had recommended boosters for those people who are severely immunocompromised. On Wednesday the government said it intended booster shots to be rolled out to the aged care sector within weeks, and to be available to the whole population by the end of the year.\\n“We don’t have the final data on this yet available, but there will also be a proportion of patients who have Covid, but they are already dying for another reason,” Nguyen said. “They may be fully vaccinated, they have a mild form of Covid, but maybe it’s brought out more severe heart failure, which they had previously.”\\nBetween 16 June and 18 October there were 61 deaths among fully vaccinated people in New South Wales, from a total of 479 Covid deaths. Data provided to Guardian Australia by NSW Health shows of the deaths in the fully vaccinated, all were aged 50 or above. Of those who died, five were in their 50s, one in their 60s, 17 in their 70s, 22 in their 80s and 16 in their 90s.\\nOn Friday, the ABC revealed 36 of the 49 aged care residents who have died after contracting Covid during NSW’s Delta outbreak were fully vaccinated. All had underlying health conditions or were in palliative care.\\nIn Victoria, 174 Covid-19 deaths occurred between 30 August and 19 October 2021. Of these, 129 were not vaccinated, 25 were partially vaccinated, and 20 were fully vaccinated with two doses. Of the 20 deaths that were fully vaccinated, one was aged in their 50s, while the remaining 19 were all aged 70 years and over.\\nProf Allen Cheng, the director of the infection prevention and healthcare epidemiology unit at Alfred Health, said only a small number of deaths had occurred in fully vaccinated people.\\n“I understand they have been mostly in older people over 70 years of age, with some in aged care facilities,” he said.\\nThe impact of the vaccine in reducing deaths among elderly people had been significant, Cheng said. Last year, before a vaccine was available, the mortality of people in their 80s with Covid was about 30%, he said.\\nCheng said it was likely that given Australia’s extraordinary vaccination coverage the bulk of people who became severely unwell or died with Covid-19 from now were fully vaccinated.\\nCovid booster vaccines to be rolled out in Australian nursing homes within weeks\\nRead more\\n“At some point, there will be more people with infections that are vaccinated than those that are not vaccinated,” he said. “As a simple thought experiment – if everyone is vaccinated, then the only cases we would have would be in vaccinated people.”\\nNguyen agreed that with high vaccination rates, “in the future a greater proportion of those in intensive care will be those who are fully vaccinated and who are frail with other conditions, rather than people who are unvaccinated”.\\n“But keep in mind that even at 95% of eligible people vaccinated, that still leaves a lot of people unvaccinated. Which is why we anticipate that in living with Covid, there will be a baseline number of Covid patients in intensive care across NSW into the foreseeable future, and we’re certainly planning for that.\\n“What that actual baseline number is, we’re still not quite sure.”\\nCheng said measures could be taken to further protect those at risk of severe disease despite vaccination. Atagi, which Cheng co-chairs, is still assessing the data for booster shots and it may make further recommendationsabout their use.\\nOnce the recommendation of booster shots was confirmed, the additional protection of the general population would further reduce the risk of the most vulnerable becoming infected.\\nAustralia is also using the novel monoclonal antibody treatment sotrovimab, which has been shown to dramatically reduce hospitalisation and risk of death in adults who are at risk of developing severe Covid-19.\\n“New monoclonal antibodies may provide additional protection, particularly in immunosuppressed people,” Cheng said. “Newer antiviral treatments may also become useful, although they are still under evaluation.”',\n",

A separate investigation found 1m doses were discarded in 10 states between December and July.\\nCovid vaccines for US children are coming but challenge will be persuading parents\\nRead more\\nStates continue tossing unused shots. Louisiana has thrown out 224,000 unused doses of the Covid vaccines – a rate that has almost tripled since the end of July, even as a deadly fourth wave of the virus gripped the state. Some of the lost doses came from opening and not finishing vials, but more than 20,000 shots simply expired.\\nThousands of doses are reportedly wasted each day in Wisconsin. In Alabama, more than 65,000 doses have been tossed; in Tennessee, it’s almost 200,000.\\nThe wasted doses represent a small fraction of the number of shots administered in these states – in Louisiana, for instance, 4.4m doses have been given out successfully.\\nBut the news comes as millions of people around the world wait for their first doses. Only 1% of the populations of low-income countries had received first shots as of July, compared with more than half of those living in a handful of high-income countries.\\nMany of the discarded doses came from pharmacies. In May, two pharmacy chains had wasted more doses than US states, territories and federal agencies combined, for almost three-quarters of tossed doses. Now, at least 7.6m discarded doses come from four major pharmacies: Walgreens, CVS, Walmart and Rite Aid.\\nThere are multiple reasons why doses have been wasted: sometimes a vial is cracked or doesn’t contain as many doses as promised; sometimes needles malfunction; freezers break down or the power goes out. Frequently, people don’t show up for appointments, and the dose set aside for them in a vial isn’t used.\\nBut as vaccinations across the country have stalled after peaking in mid-April, a growing issue is simply that the vaccines are expiring amid vaccine hesitancy in the US that is more widespread than first imagined.\\nBefore June, a little over 2m doses had gone to waste, NBC News reported. But over the summer, those figures surged – alongside the virus itself – sixfold as doses expired and vaccinations flagged.\\nThe Biden administration has pushed to use the US vaccine stockpile for boosters, sometimes clashing with scientific agencies on who needs the added protection of an additional shot.\\nOfficials are also working with vaccine manufacturers to reduce the number of doses in each vial.\\nIn the face of global inequities, it’s not as simple as states donating unused vaccines. The doses already distributed to states can’t be repurposed internationally because of bureaucratic and safety concerns around storing the vaccines correctly.\\nJoe Biden has vowed to vaccinate 70% of the world in the next year, and has committed to donate several million doses for use abroad. But in the meantime, many countries are struggling to provide shots to the most vulnerable and those working on the frontlines of the pandemic, while Americans refuse the immunizations.\\nManufacturers should also scale up production to address global shortages, the administration has said. Moderna, for instance, needs to “step up as a company” when it comes to global production of vaccines, David Kessler, the Biden administration’s chief science officer of the Covid-19 response, said on Wednesday.',\n",

She said: “We hosted the G7 this year. We are claiming global leadership in vaccine rollout, but when you look in detail at the level of ambition we are showing, we are falling way behind other major economies.\\n“In a critical week with the G20, the spending review and the Cop26, we are weakening our international reputation.”\\nCovid: UK faces ‘another lockdown Christmas if we don’t act soon’\\nRead more\\nThe One figures, released by the analytics company Airfinity, show the EU committed to sharing 200m doses by the end of 2021, the US 280m, France 60m, Germany 100m, Italy 45m, Canada 41.5m and the UK 30m. The latest figures also show that the UK has so far distributed only a third of the vaccines it has pledged to this year.\\nThe UK had an opportunity to lift the level of commitment it first made at the G7 summit in June when Joe Biden convened a further pledging conference during the UN general assembly in September, but the UK made no announcements, and the prime minister, Boris Johnson, did not even attend.\\nAt the UN summit, Biden increased the level of US commitment, saying: “For every one shot we’ve administered to date in America, we have now committed to do three shots to the rest of the world.”\\nGreenhill said: “The UK government is being extremely cautious about the vaccines it needs for the domestic rollout. We understand the concerns around the domestic situation, but from a moral perspective it is wrong that a lot of people in the UK are getting their third dose when even health workers in low-income countries have not had a single dose.\\n“There is a wider practical self-interest point – if we are to end the pandemic we really need to vaccinate the world so we get the global economy back on track.”\\nShe added that there was no sign the UK could justify the disparity in vaccine distribution pledges on the grounds of suffering uniquely difficult supply-side constraints. The UK is committed to sharing 80% of its 30m vaccines this year through the global purchasing and distribution mechanism known as Covax, with the remainder distributed bilaterally.\\nThe UK’s stated plans are more ambitious for vaccine distribution in 2022, promising to distribute 100m vaccines by the end of next year, the same target as Germany, but less than France, the EU and the US. However, the One campaign said it was critical that doses were distributed quickly so they would be available for use this winter rather than in spring. “Speed really matters,” Greenhill said.\\nThe One figures dovetail with a call made by the former prime minister Gordon Brown for an emergency airlift of surplus vaccines. He calculates that there are 240m unused vaccines worldwide that, if deployed to the right countries, could save 60,000 lives.\\nBrown, who was appointed last month as an adviser to the World Health Organization, called on the G20 to back “the biggest peacetime public policy decision” by supporting an October airlift to send unused vaccines to parts of the global south that are in the most need.\\nAt the G7 summit, the UK said its vaccine dose-sharing costs would be counted as additional to the overseas development assistance (ODA) budget, but in recent weeks that has been brought into question. Greenhill said that if the vaccines costs were included as part of ODA, the impact could be as much as £1bn on the rest of the aid budget.\\nThe precise cost of dose-sharing per country is hard to calculate because of the lack of transparency about the original cost of the doses.',\n",

       "  'This month, California became the first state to require Covid-19 vaccines for all schoolchildren but the provision came with a loophole: students will be granted religious exemptions.\\nCalifornia, which currently has the lowest coronavirus case rate in the US, has been issuing a series of sweeping mandates, requiring that healthcare workers, state employees, care workers and school staff get the vaccine. But in each case, Californians are able to ask for personal belief exemptions – and they are doing so in droves.\\nCovid vaccines for US children are coming but challenge will be persuading parents\\nRead more\\nEpidemiologists are concerned that the loophole will embolden the vaccine-hesitant to evade requirements and undermine the state’s progress against the pandemic. And lawyers and legal experts are bracing for a deluge of complaints over the blurry lines that define “sincerely held” objections to the vaccine.\\nMany parents and even some teachers have raised opposition to the mandates, with walkouts and protests already taking place across the state. In rural northern California and conservative patches of the south, parents picketed against the public health measures on Monday, insisting that they wouldn’t “co-parent with the government”. Last week, teachers at a school district in Los Angeles who were denied religious exemptions demonstrated outside the headquarters.\\nMeanwhile, the Los Angeles fire department fielded more than 450 requests for exemptions, while a quarter of the Beverly Hills fire department requested exemptions. In San Francisco, some 800 city workers – including police officers and firefighters – have asked for exemptions, though the city has yet to approve a single request.\\nAs state and city officials increasingly enforce strict mandates, a cottage industry of anti-vaccine and religious groups has cropped up to help people dodge requirements. In Rocklin, California – just north-east of the state capital, Sacramento – a megachurch pastor has been offering religious exemption letters to all who want them. Pastor Greg Fairrington of Destiny Christian church, who has organized protests at the state capitol against the state’s vaccine requirements for school children, healthcare workers and first responders, has held that he is not anti-vaccine, but “the vaccine poses a morally compromising situation for many people of faith”. The Christian legal advocacy group Liberty Counsel offers letter templates to claim a religious exemption, as well.\\nPastor Greg Fairrington of Destiny Christian church. Photograph: Twitter\\n“Even when you have a few individuals that are refusing or hesitating to take the vaccine, in large cities like San Francisco that can have huge public health implications,” said Lorena Garcia, an associate professor of epidemiology at the UC Davis School of Medicine. A bus driver, police officer or teacher with a vaccine exemption not only risks catching the coronavirus but also passing it on to one of the hundreds of other people they interact with – especially immunocompromised people who are at greater risk of catching the virus even if they are vaccinated.\\nBecause laws protecting religious or philosophical objections offer broad leeway for those seeking waivers, amid rampant misinformation about the safety of the Covid-19 vaccine, Garcia said she worried about how many people will exploit the waivers. Ultimately, she said, it may not matter that not only public health officials but also prominent religious leaders have been encouraging people to get vaccinated. Indeed, Pope Francis, leaders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Orthodox Jewish rabbis and Islamic leaders in the Fiqh Council of North America have all been touting the vaccine.\\nLeaders of fringe religious groups have been helping fuel and spread anti-vaccine fervor on social media – and amplifying the tried and tested strategy of invoking one’s personal beliefs and first amendment freedom of religion and expression to sidestep public health policies.\\nFederal and state laws offer protections for workers who want to decline a vaccine due to their religious or philosophical beliefs, which can be broadly defined. Beliefs based on an organized religion’s teachings are protected, but so are other “sincerely held” beliefs or observances that are important to an individual, said Dorit Reiss, a law professor at UC Hastings. The most an employer can do to contest waiver requests is to probe the consistency of employees’ beliefs – if they oppose the vaccine because they oppose the use of fetal cells in research, do they also refuse to take Tylenol, Tums and other medications developed using fetal cells? But the tactic is “rife with legal pitfalls”, Reiss said. Ultimately, a sincerely held belief may not have to be rational or consistent in order to be protected by the law.\\nThese laws are strong because they “were created to protect people from real discrimination, in situations where, for example, a Jewish employee might be forced to work on a Saturday, or a Sikh employee is asked to remove his turban”, said Reiss. But they weren’t designed for situations in which one employee’s belief system puts others’ lives at risk, she said.\\nProtesters rally outside a courthouse in New York last week where teachers are suing against vaccine mandates, stating that they are immoral and illegal. Photograph: MediaPunch/Rex/Shutterstock\\nWorkplaces and agencies that are unwilling to grant exemptions are required to provide “reasonable accommodations” for employees who do not want the vaccine – which could include unpaid leave, reassignment or allowances to work from home, Reiss explained. But employees can and do challenge such moves with lawsuits.\\nAnd while anti-vaccine websites and forums have for years openly admitted to lying about their religion to obtain exemptions, as Reiss found in a 2014 survey of such sites, “the pandemic has increased the scale” at which the tactic is employed. Meanwhile, employees with disabilities – including those who are immunocompromised – are limited in how much they can do to push back against co-workers claiming exemptions.\\nHanna Sweiss, an associate at the law firm Fisher Phillips, said in recent weeks she and her colleagues have been flooded with questions from employers in healthcare, hospitality and other industries about how to comply with vaccine requirements – including upcoming federal mandates for workplaces – while fielding requests for waivers. “It’s been coming up a lot lately, and we’re getting questions about religious accommodations requests when it comes to vaccines, but also Covid testing,” she said.\\nAs such requests flood state agencies and school administrations, public health experts and parents have been asking lawmakers to tighten exemption rules, as they did in 2015 when they passed a law eliminating the personal belief exemption for childhood immunizations. But that law doesn’t apply to immunization requirements issued without a vote from the legislature. Richard Pan, a pediatrician and state legislator who authored the 2015 bill, has said he will consider addressing the loophole if cases surge once again.',\n",
       "  'Downing Street has confirmed that Covid vaccine appointments for children will be bookable from next week in England, as Boris Johnson said the UK still faced a “difficult winter” as a result of coronavirus and flu putting pressure on the NHS.\\nAfter the latest daily number of deaths climbed to 223 – the highest level since early March – the prime minister’s spokesperson echoed concerns from the NHS England chief executive, Amanda Pritchard, that people needed to be reminded the virus was still circulating in order to drive up vaccination rates.\\n“I think we absolutely want to get that message out,” the spokesperson said on Tuesday, adding that there was no reason yet for the government to dust off its “plan B” of winter measures for England because hospitalisations and deaths remained “broadly flat”.\\nHe defended the rollout of jabs for 12- to 15-year-olds, which has been accused of progressing too slowly, and confirmed that the programme would be extended beyond schools. Doses will be able to be administered at vaccination sites and parents and guardians of eligible children will receive a text or letter shortly inviting them to use the national booking service or ring 119 to book an appointment.\\nAfter a cabinet meeting held at the Science Museum on Tuesday, Johnson’s spokesperson said: “The prime minister stressed that our autumn and winter plan continues to keep the virus under control and that case rates and hospital admissions remain broadly flat. He re-emphasised that we must put all our energies into our vaccination programmes and set out that the booster vaccination programme continues at pace, with over 3.7 million people having received their third jab.”\\nHe said Johnson told his senior ministers that “although we face a difficult winter, we have a plan in place to steer the country through this period and people should continue to follow the guidance and get their jabs when called upon.”\\nExplaining how children will soon be able to get jabbed at vaccine centres, Johnson’s spokesperson said: “The vaccine sites will come online shortly… Children will be able to get vaccinated at the existing centres, which include GP practices, pharmacies and other local sites. It’s simply an expansion of the programme as we saw at the start of the very early days of the initial vaccine rollout.”\\nHe called the initial approach of offering jabs to children in schools “tried and tested” and said this had been an “important function in the expansion of our programme”, but added: “We want to do everything possible to expand and ensure we can get these jabs in as efficiently and safely as possible.”\\nThe number of pupils in England who are off school because of Covid has risen again, according to the fortnightly Department for Education attendance statistics. The data shows 209,000 children were not in school for Covid-related reasons on 14 October, up from 204,000 when figures last came out. Of these, 111,000 were confirmed Covid cases, an increase of 9,000.\\nOverall, the proportion of pupils attending school went up marginally over the past fortnight, from 89.5% on 30 September to 90%, but Covid-related absence in state schools edged up from 2.5% to 2.6%.\\nThe figures are the third batch of fortnightly statistics to be published since schools in England reopened for the autumn term with significant reduced mitigation measures, and ministers will be hoping the sharp rise in infection and absence rates is beginning to ease.\\nA fortnight ago, the number of pupils off school for Covid reasons jumped by 66%, from 122,000 two weeks earlier.\\nJames Bowen, the director of policy for the school leaders’ union NAHT, said: “We currently have record Covid-related absence in schools. The government cannot just sit back and accept the growing numbers of cases amongst school-age children.”\\nThe health secretary, Sajid Javid, told the House of Commons he would publish a “detailed programme for the winter” for the NHS within a fortnight.\\nThe shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, had asked what Javid would do personally to avert “a winter crisis of misery for patients”. Javid acknowledged “the huge pressure the NHS is facing” and conceded that “the winter is going to be particularly tough”.\\nResponding to Jeremy Hunt, Javid conceded there were shortages across the NHS, including among people taking 999 calls and 111 calls and in “emergency care generally”.\\nAnnouncing that parents would be able to use the vaccination booking system for their 12- to 15-year-olds to improve take-up, he said the government wanted to “make the most of half-term next week”.',\n",

Others on the JCVI are understood to be resistant to the idea, arguing that it has no clinical benefit and six months should be seen as a minimum.\\nBooster vaccinations are now open to people aged 50-plus, those with underlying health conditions, and frontline health and care workers, totalling about 30 million people across the UK.\\nBetween 200,000 and 250,000 jabs are now being administered a day, with 5m done so far, meaning that at the current pace it would not be completed until the new year.\\nMinisters see boosters as a key element in trying to ensure England does not face new Covid restrictions in the winter due to pressures on the NHS, with a series of studies indicating that a third injection can significantly increase protection against the virus.\\nJohnson visited a vaccination centre in west London on Friday, part of an effort to promote the booster programme, and said older people in particular were vulnerable to the “serious effects from waning immunity”.\\nHe said: “I think that people should be coming forward with the same spirit of determination to get their boosters as we saw earlier on this year. It’s a very good thing to do. It gets you a huge amount of protection and we always expected that we would see numbers rise right about now. That is happening.”',\n",

       "  'L\\nooking back to spring last year, many people were predicting that we wouldn’t have any vaccines available by now, and even the most optimistic didn’t predict that 6.5bn doses of highly effective Covid-19 vaccines would have been administered globally. Indeed, it is truly amazing that, within the next month, 50% of the world’s population will have received at least one dose of a vaccine to protect them against Covid-19, with 20-30 million more doses being given globally every day. To make and deliver so many doses in 2021 reflects astonishing global endeavours by manufacturing facility staff, those involved in the logistics of getting the vaccines to clinics, and an army of healthcare workers and vaccinators.\\nBut this remarkable progress is tempered by an uncomfortable moral and ethical predicament: simply put, the doses still aren’t shared fairly. That global 50% vaccinated figure hides gross inequity. More than 95% of people in low-income countries are yet to receive even their first dose, compared with over 60% in high income countries who have received at least one dose. We are protected, but they are not. To effect change in global mortality this year, it isn’t enough to promise to share doses – 1bn doses in total were pledged in June by the G7 – we have to actually give the doses to those at risk of dying, and stick the needles in before they meet the virus. Tragically, a million deaths have occurred since that G7 pledge according to Our World in Data.\\nThe Guardian view on global vaccine inequality: unwise as well as unethical\\nRead more\\nSupply is constrained still, though the substantial increase in Covax distribution (340m doses so far) over the past few months is a reason for hope that the situation is improving. There are more donations and supply is going up. It will get better. But for many hundreds of thousands of people, it won’t be soon enough.\\nTo make matters worse, many countries have announced or have started booster programmes, adding to the moral jeopardy the risk that first doses will be further delayed. While the case for boosters is not yet agreed by all scientists, it is possible that boosters may bring some additional gain for some people, even though the potential benefit for most individuals is small. Most double-jabbed people are so highly protected against severe disease that a booster dose won’t improve protection much.\\nBut there is a much stronger case, and there is no doubt among scientists, that first doses are lifesaving for the unvaccinated. Unvaccinated people should be prioritised wherever they live. With this in mind, the director general of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, called for a moratorium on boosters till next year as booster doses will take away from the global supply and deepen the equity problem. For equity, the case is not so focused on whether to boost, but when. It is all about timing.\\nThe “to boost or not to boost” moral dilemma is not in the purview of individual citizens who ponder whether to roll up their sleeve when offered a booster by a vaccine clinic this week. A dose that is in the vaccine clinic fridge (or freezer) cannot be redirected to someone else in another country, because the regulatory hurdles and shelf-life simply make redistribution of this dose not practical. Redistribution has to happen prior to the release of vaccine doses to the national health system. A protest against vaccination at individual level will be misdirected and risks wasting these precious doses. If you are asked to roll up your sleeve, then you should do so.\\nThe equity issues of the pandemic have brought into sharp relief the conflict between national expediency and noble foreign policy. There is no easy answer. Governments must take an uncomfortable look at the human, political and financial cost of inequity in this pandemic, and develop principles for future pandemic preparedness that embrace a set of values that include a spotlight on moral and ethical integrity.\\nThere is clear evidence of a failure by governments to serve the world’s poor. But, for now, individuals must make the most of the vaccines that their healthcare systems make available to them.\\nProfessor Sir Andrew Pollard is chief investigator of the Oxford Covid-19 vaccine trials, and is director of the Oxford Vaccine Group',\n",

Outbreaks fizzle out on their own.” If the R value – or reproductive rate of the virus – can remain below 1, then the effects of the virus would be “greatly blunted”, he says.\\nBut the centre’s modelling shows that because Delta is so transmissible, population immunity is out of reach by way of the vaccine alone; other public measures must be adopted to bolster its effects. Even if 80% of the population is vaccinated, a community outbreak of the virus would lead to thousands of deaths and put immense strain on the already under-resourced healthcare system.\\nPrime Minister Jacinda Ardern hopes to lead the world in Covid vaccination rates.

There are now 1,131 cases in the outbreak of the Delta variant, and 902 cases have recovered. All of Friday’s cases are linked to household contacts or contacts of known cases.\\nThe mood in New Zealand on Covid is changing – and Jacinda Ardern knows it\\nTim Watkin\\nRead more\\nAll about access\\nReaching 90% vaccination coverage must also mean ensuring that target is hit within communities such as Māori and Pasifika populations, a senior lecturer at Massey University, Jagadish Thaker, said.\\nA Ministry of Health survey reports that 10% of the population say they will not get a vaccine, and another 10% are still unsure if they will, and contrary to perception, Thaker’s latest research shows hesitancy among Māori is lower than that of other ethnicities.\\nDespite this, Māori vaccination rates are lagging behind, with about 52% of the population having had one dose, compared with about 70% for Pākehā (European New Zealanders).\\nAccess to the vaccine is the biggest hurdle for Māori communities, he said.\\n“Research shows that where there are higher density of Māori population, they have to travel a lot more. We had a whole year-and-a-half to know this and so it is surprising now that there is an attempt to increase accessibility,” Thaker said.\\nHe believes 90% target is achievable, but that goal must be equitable across ethnicities, otherwise high vaccination rates will “ultimately be meaningless” because Māori and Pasifika are more likely to die from Covid-19.\\nThe government has been seeking ways to reach communities, including setting up a “Mr-Whippy-style” vaccine bus, and considering giving vaccines at popular destinations like fast-food outlets.\\nArdern says vaccines are a cause for hope – with them, the current model of widespread lockdowns could be scrapped.\\n“We used lockdowns because none of us risk being exposed to the virus. We had to isolate away everyone. With vaccines we can turn that model on its head, we can isolate those who have Covid-19, rather than everyone because we have the individual armour of the vaccine.”\\n“We could take level four out of the toolbox.”\\n‘Calculated risk’: Ardern gambles as New Zealand Covid restrictions eased\\nRead more\\nShe says that with Delta, there are still requirements to use additional public health measures suggested by Te Punaha Matatini, due to its highly infectious nature.\\nIn the past 18 months, Ardern says that New Zealand has had some of the lowest hospitalisation and death rates in the world and more days without restrictions than almost any other country. Now, she wants the country to lead the way in vaccination rates.\\n“There is now an opportunity for us all to grasp to be one of the most vaccinated countries in the world … it comes down to each and every one of us. We have the supply of vaccines we need; we have the workforce ready to do the job,” she said.\\nSo far, 73% of the eligible population in New Zealand has been vaccinated with one dose. Nearly 40% of the eligible population has been fully vaccinated.',\n",

Another third of those surveyed want to wait and see how the rollout goes.\\nWill vaccination become part of the back-to-school ritual?\\nEmma Brockes\\nRead more\\n“What’s going to be actually more challenging, beyond having the infrastructure to be able to administer the Covid-19 vaccines, is ensuring that parents feel comfortable vaccinating their children,” Syra Madad, an infectious disease epidemiologist and senior director of the System-wide Special Pathogens Program at NYC Health + Hospitals, told the Guardian.\\nAbout half of children 12 and older have been vaccinated in the months since the vaccines were given the green light for those ages.\\nVaccinating people of all ages is a crucial part of ending the pandemic, said Dr Saad Omer, an infectious disease epidemiologist and director of the Yale Institute for Global Health.\\n“We will not be able to get out of this pandemic without vaccinating children – both for their own sake and for the sake of having overall protection,” he added.\\nCovid-19 cases in parts of the US are beginning to plateau or decline – and that could give families a false sense of security that vaccinating kids isn’t necessary, Madad said. But that’s actually the best time to get the shots, because the vaccines can prevent new spikes.\\n“You can’t vaccinate your way out of a surge. You want to make sure that you have immunity built up to prevent that surge from happening,” Madad said.\\n“Right now, we have every indication that we may see another surge,” Madad added.\\nA little over half (56.5%) of the US population has been fully vaccinated – not nearly enough coverage to prevent future outbreaks from spreading. And because wealthy countries have taken the lion’s share of the vaccines, other countries have extremely low vaccination rates.\\nAny community, at home or abroad, with low rates could contribute to the emergence of other, possibly more serious variants.\\n“If that does happen, we want to prevent that surge from happening, and the best way that we know is obviously vaccinating ahead of time,” Madad said.\\nYet communication from federal agencies has frequently been flawed and politicized.\\n“With the previous administration, it was nonexistent almost, and it was every man, woman, child for themselves, to be very honest,” Madad said. While the Biden administration had done a better job, she said, “we continue to struggle with that even today – we see that even with the booster shot communication. It’s been very confusing and frustrating.”\\nConversations about the importance, safety and effectiveness of the vaccines also need to happen at all levels, not just the federal government, she said. “At the local level, at the community level, at the individual level – that’s what makes an impact. Not with somebody standing at a podium saying ‘this is safe and effective.’”\\nPeople are more likely to trust their own doctors, community leaders, friends and family when it comes to health advice, Madad said.\\nA minor receiving a Covid-19 vaccine in Asunción, Paraguay.

Photograph: Norberto Duarte/AFP/Getty Images\\nThere have also been mixed messages from public health leaders about how much children are affected by Covid and whether they need the vaccines at all. That’s also diminishing confidence and adding confusion about vaccines, Omer said: “The fact that a lot of parents are getting mixed messages has confounded this issue.\\n“Public health agencies have been well behind in having effective communications campaigns – for all sorts of vaccinations,” Omer said. “This time, we need to get ahead of it.”\\nHe recommended having a communications campaign for families ready to go at the same time the pediatric vaccines hit the shelves.\\n“We need to engage pediatricians – and arm them with not just facts, but approaches to communicating around Covid vaccines,” he said. “There’s a whole science of communication, but we haven’t done that.”\\nTalking about safety and efficacy from the clinical trials is important – and so is removing barriers to access and making vaccinations as easy as possible, Omer said.\\nWhen the first one-third of families rush out to get the shots, he said, the CDC should immediately conduct studies on side-effects in real-world settings, using databases like the Vaccine Safety DataLink, which compiles millions of records from providers.\\nThe CDC has produced some data from these sources, “but not as much as needed”, Omer said.\\nFarther down the line, officials can build on existing childhood vaccine mandates – but it’s important not to do this too soon, he said. “Before you mandate it, make sure it’s super easy to get your child vaccinated.\\n“California is talking about fall 2022 – that’s a reasonable timeframe,” Omer said. Mandates and requirements shouldn’t be “too punitive”, offering alternatives like masking and regular testing options at first, as a “way to nudge parents”.\\nOmer characterized the US response to the pandemic as “doing the right thing, but a few months late”. Scaling up testing, monitoring breakthrough cases, mandating masks, digitizing immunization records – the US has consistently been behind the eight ball on mitigation and prevention, and Omer is worried about what will happen if leaders aren’t able to rise to this occasion.\\n“The first rule of controlling an outbreak of any size is to outpace it – to get ahead of it.

       "  'We did it,” said Ursula von der Leyen in her annual state of the union address last week. With more than 70% of its adult population now fully vaccinated against the coronavirus, Europe is, “against all critics, among the world leaders”.\\nMoreover, the Commission president said, the EU had exported half its vaccines: “We delivered more than 700 million doses to the European people, and we delivered more than 700 million doses to the rest of the world. We are the only region to achieve that.”\\nIt was a far cry from earlier this year, when the US and UK were jabbing their populations at record rates and gloating headlines proclaimed the EU’s painfully slow early vaccine rollout a “crisis”, a “catastrophe”, a “debacle”, a “disaster” and a “fiasco”.\\nIn March, the World Health Organization compared Europe’s rollout unfavourably with the UK’s, calling it “unacceptably slow”. As late as April, only 11% of the bloc’s population had received at least one shot, compared with 29% in the US and 46% in Britain. But last week, according to Our World in Data, the picture looked different.\\nNine EU countries, including Portugal, Spain, Ireland, France, Belgium and Italy, have now administered one or both doses of a Covid-19 vaccine to a larger share of their populations than the UK, with a further five having overtaken the US.\\nEarly criticism was certainly justified: hit by stumbles and shortages, the EU was simply slow to get its act together. Health having always been a responsibility of the member states, that may have been inevitable, but it does not make it excusable.\\nThe 27 approved the commission’s collective purchase plan in June 2020, dissolving a vaccine alliance initiated by France and Germany in an attempt to avoid member states competing with each other – and the largest economies hogging supplies.\\nWith no relevant procurement experience, however, the commission approached talks with manufacturers like trade negotiations, prioritising price over delivery deadlines. Some contracts were signed months later than those of rival buyers.\\nThen the EU regulator opted for a more thorough, but lengthier, approval process, and AstraZeneca, from whom the bloc had ordered 300 million doses for the first two quarters of 2021, failed to deliver more than a fraction, triggering a fractious court case.\\nSuccess is far from even across the bloc: Romania and Bulgaria have only vaccinated 27% and 16%.\\nIn February Von der Leyen conceded the bloc was “not where we want to be. We were late to authorise. We were too optimistic when it came to massive production, and perhaps too confident that what we ordered would actually be delivered on time.”\\nNext, rare blood clotting problems led 13 EU states to suspend the Anglo-Swedish manufacturer’s shot, denting public confidence in a planned mainstay of the EU’s vaccination programme, with several later authorising it only in older age groups. By early summer, though, things were changing. In mid-April the commission opened talks on a new order for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, ultimately concluding a mega-deal for 1.8 billion shots through to 2023. By May and June, Europe was awash with Pfizer.\\nSuccess is far from even across the bloc: poorer states, such as Romania and Bulgaria, are struggling, with 27% and 16% of their populations vaccinated.\\nBut, in general, European decisions are paying dividends. The bloc’s Covid passport, showing proof of vaccination, recovery or a negative test, has allowed millions of EU citizens to holiday abroad this summer with minimal fuss, encouraging take-up.\\nNational vaccination drives have also been boosted, sometimes dramatically, in more than a dozen EU countries by domestic health passes, now needed to access anything from museums and gyms to cafes, shopping centres and trains.\\nFurther to increasing vaccination rates, many member states have – in contrast to the UK – already administered first jabs to as many as 80% of 12 to 17-year-olds.\\nRather than being a marathon not a sprint, as EU officials like to say, vaccination campaigns should probably be both. But after a slow start that will certainly have cost lives, the EU’s collective approach may, finally, be paying off.',\n",
       "  'Healthy boys may be more likely to be admitted to hospital with a rare side-effect of the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid vaccine that causes inflammation of the heart than with Covid itself, US researchers claim.\\nTheir analysis of medical data suggests that boys aged 12 to 15, with no underlying medical conditions, are four to six times more likely to be diagnosed with vaccine-related myocarditis than ending up in hospital with Covid over a four-month period.\\nMost children who experienced the rare side-effect had symptoms within days of the second shot of Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, though a similar side-effect is seen with the Moderna jab. About 86% of the boys affected required some hospital care, the authors said.\\nSaul Faust, professor of paediatric immunology and infectious diseases at the University of Southampton, who was not involved in the work, said the findings appeared to justify the cautious approach taken on teenage vaccines by the UK’s Joint Committee on Vaccines and Immunisation.\\nThe JCVI did not recommend vaccinating healthy 12 to 15-year-olds, but referred the matter to the UK’s chief medical officers who are expected to make a final decision next week. Children aged 12 to 15 who are particularly vulnerable to Covid, or who live with an at-risk person, are eligible for the shots.\\nIn the latest study, which has yet to be peer reviewed, Dr Tracy Høeg at the University of California and colleagues analysed adverse reactions to Covid vaccines in US children aged 12 to 17 during the first six months of 2021. They estimate the rate of myocarditis after two shots of Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine to be 162.2 cases per million for healthy boys aged 12 to 15 and 94 cases per million for healthy boys aged 16 to 17. The equivalent rates for girls were 13.4 and 13 cases per million, respectively. At current US infection rates, the risk of a healthy adolescent being taken to hospital with Covid in the next 120 days is about 44 per million, they said.\\nHow reliable the data is and whether similar numbers could be seen in the UK if healthy 12 to 15-year-olds are vaccinated are unclear: vaccine reactions are recorded differently in the US and shots are given at longer time intervals in the UK. According to the UK medicines regulator, the rate of myocarditis after Covid vaccination is only six per million shots of Pfizer/BioNTech.\\nSo far, UK children have not been admitted to hospital for Covid in large numbers and may not be at great risk of long Covid. While the recent Clock study found that up to 14% of children who caught Covid may still have symptoms 15 weeks later, levels of fatigue appear similar to those in children who have not caught the virus. This suggests that children may be spared some of the most debilitating problems seen in adult long Covid.\\nWhy aren’t children being vaccinated in the UK? – podcast\\nRead more\\nThe overwhelming majority of myocarditis appears after the second dose of vaccine, so offering single shots could protect children while reducing their risk of the side effect even further.\\n“While myocarditis after vaccination is exceptionally rare, we may be able to change the first or second doses or combine vaccines differently to avoid the risk at all, once we understand the physiology better,” said Prof Faust. “On balance, there is no urgency to immunise children from a medical perspective, although if schools are unable to maintain education for the vast majority at all times, the overall balance could shift. If my two teenage children are offered the vaccine by the NHS my GP wife and I will have no hesitation in allowing them to receive the vaccine.”\\nProf Adam Finn, a member of JCVI at the University of Bristol, said: “I stand by the JCVI advice, which is not to go ahead at this time with vaccinating healthy 12 to 15-year-olds on health outcome risk-benefit grounds given the current uncertainty – as there is a small but plausible risk that rare harms could turn out to outweigh modest benefits.”\\nThe MHRA said it has been closely monitoring all available data on the potential risk of myocarditis and pericarditis following Covid-19 vaccination. “We have concluded that the Covid-19 vaccines made by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna may be linked with a small increase in the risk of these very rare conditions. The cases tended to be mild and the vast majority recovered with simple treatment and rest,” they added.\\nThe spokesperson said the latest study had been considered by the government’s independent advisory body, the Covid-19 vaccines benefit risk expert working group, which found that the interpretation of the findings was limited by the fact that the study did not take into account differences in treatment practices when comparing hospitalisation rates between Covid-19 infections and myocarditis and pericarditis presenting post-vaccination, and there was no assessment of severity and duration of illness after admission.\\n“Safety monitoring strategies are in place for individuals under 18 years, including monitoring myocarditis and pericarditis occurring post-vaccination and the long term outcomes with these events. The MHRA continues to keep the safety of Covid-19 vaccines under close and continual review,” the spokesperson added.\\nThis article was amended on 12 September 2021 to add feedback from the MHRA',\n",

They are what the ONS describes as “breakthrough” deaths.\\nIt shows that just over three-quarters of these deaths (76.6%) occurred in those who were clinically extremely vulnerable – a slightly higher proportion than for other Covid-19 deaths (74.5%) and deaths not involving Covid-19 (69.7%).\\nOf the breakthrough deaths, 61.1% occurred in males, which is higher than for other Covid-19 deaths (52.2%) and deaths not involving Covid-19 (48.5%), while 13% were among people who were immunocompromised.\\nExperts emphasised the importance of context in terms of the data, which covered a period when the seven-day average daily UK deaths varied between six and more than 1,200 per day. Trends were increasing at the end of the ONS study period, when rates were about 25 per day, while daily death rates are now consistently over 100 per day.\\nDr Duncan Robertson, a data analyst at Loughborough University who has been focusing on Covid-19 modelling and analysis, said: “By definition, as the proportion of vaccinated people increases, fewer remain in the unvaccinated category. In the extreme, if everyone were vaccinated, 100% of deaths would be of vaccinated people, just as before the vaccine rollout, 0% of deaths would be of vaccinated people.”\\nBut he added: “What is clear from the ONS data is the significance of being fully vaccinated – full vaccination offers very high – but not perfect - protection against death, where only having a first dose offers significantly less protection.”\\nThe PNS data came days after Public Health England published figures showing the vaccination status of individuals who were infected, who were hospitalised, and who died.\\n“While figures for protection against infection needs careful interpretation, particularly in the estimates of population in each age category, it is clear that vaccine protection against death is very high after the second dose,” added Dr Robertson, who stressed that work still needed to be done to ensure that vaccinations reach those in cohorts where there had already been significant uptake.\\nThere are about 1 million over-60s who are not fully vaccinated, he pointed out. Only two-thirds of black over-50s have been vaccinated compared with more than 9 in 10 white over-50s.

Four million doses of the Pfizer jab are being sent from the UK to Australia as part of that deal.\\n“By working closely with our friends in South Korea, this vaccine swap will maximise their rollout speed without having an impact on the UK’s vaccine programme,” said Sajid Javid, the health secretary.\\nIn the UK, more than 48 million people – 89% of over-16s – have had a first vaccine dose and more than 44 million – 81% of over-16s – have had two doses.\\nJavid said there would be no impact on the UK’s Covid vaccine booster programme or on supplies to the Covax vaccine sharing scheme.\\n“Separately, we continue to deliver on our commitment to donate 100m doses to nations around the world by June 2022 to ensure as many people across the world are as safe from Covid-19 as possible,” he said.\\nThe UK has donated 10.3m Covid vaccines to other countries, including 6.2m to vulnerable nations through Covax, exceeding a target of providing 5m by September.\\nThe Covax doses were a share of the 100m vaccines that Johnson pledged the UK would share over the following year at June’s G7 in Cornwall, with 30m due to be sent by the end of the year.\\nLiz Truss, the foreign secretary, said: “The UK is playing a leading role in the global response to the Covid-19 pandemic, donating 100m vaccine doses across the world and have committed £548m to Covax.\\n“The Republic of Korea is a strategic partner for the UK and the sharing of 1m vaccines benefits both countries as we help build resistance against Covid-19 and save lives.”',\n",
       "  'Healthcare staff can decide whether children get a Covid vaccine against the wishes of their parents, according to government guidelines published on Wednesday that left some headteachers fearing protests at the school gates.\\nThe guidelines say vaccinations for children aged 12 to 15 will be administered by School Age Immunisation Service (SAIS) teams that already carry out flu and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccinations in England. The role of schools will be limited to providing a site and distributing information and consent forms to pupils and parents.\\nIn cases where parents withhold consent but the child wants to go ahead, the guidelines say the vaccination teams will determine if the child is able to make an informed decision – known as Gillick competence – and “make every effort to contact a parent to check before they proceed”.\\nTeachers in difficult position over teenage Covid jab rollout, say unions\\nRead more\\n“If a parent objects to their child being vaccinated but the child wants to be vaccinated and is judged to be Gillick competent, the healthcare professional will try to reach agreement between the parent and child. However, the parent cannot overrule the decision of a Gillick competent child,” the guidelines state. In that scenario the child will be vaccinated.\\nIn cases where parents refuse consent and the child is not deemed to be Gillick competent or does not want to be vaccinated, the guidelines from the UK health security agency say a vaccination will not be given.\\nAccording to the NHS, Gillick competence is when children under the age of 16 “can consent to their own treatment if they’re believed to have enough intelligence, competence and understanding to fully appreciate what’s involved in their treatment”.\\nSome headteachers remain worried that parents who oppose vaccination may attempt to contact their child’s school directly, despite the school playing no part in the decision.\\nJules White, the headteacher of Tanbridge House secondary school in Sussex, said many of his fellow school leaders wanted to avoid being caught up in any conflicts between children and their family over the issue.\\nWhite said: “The guidance seems to make it possible for a child considered Gillick competent to have a vaccination administered on a school site without permission from a parent or carer. While that decision will be made by trained professionals in the SAIS team, it leaves headteachers and other school staff in a potentially very difficult position.\\n“In a situation where an issue like this arises I would prefer the matter to be dealt with away from the school site – at, for example, a GP’s surgery or local medical centre.”\\nThe guidance also warns schools to prepare for protests or other disruption.\\nIt says: “We know that some schools are receiving campaign letters and emails with misinformation about the vaccine programme and would like advice on how to handle protests in the event they were to take place at school.\\n“In the event of a protest or disruptive activity outside a school, or if schools know a protest is planned, they should alert the SAIS provider, local authority and police contacts to discuss the best way to manage the situation.”\\nThe UK’s chief medical officers this week decided to extend voluntary single doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine to children aged 12 to 15, after the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation had earlier said the benefits of immunising the age group were less certain than in older teenagers.\\nNHS foundation trusts have begun contacting schools to arrange on-site vaccination days, with some expecting to start seeking consent from parents shortly. Schools will be able to combine the Covid and flu vaccinations in a single visit.\\nGeoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said he welcomed the guidance clarifying that legal accountability for offering vaccines was with the school immunisation service, after headteachers reported receiving letters from pressure groups.\\n“The guidance is absolutely clear that schools are not responsible for mediating between parents and children who may disagree about whether or not to consent. This is the role of registered nurses in the School Age Immunisation Service,” Barton said.\\n“We are very concerned about the possibility of protests being held outside schools, and we are pleased to see that the guidance references this and provides advice about how to respond to this threat.”',\n",
       "  'M\\natt Wynter, a 42-year-old music agent from Leek, Staffordshire, was working out in his local gym in mid-August when he saw, to his great surprise, that his best friend, Marcus Birks, was on the television. He jumped off the elliptical trainer and listened carefully.\\nThe first thing he noticed was that Birks, who was also from Leek and a performer with the dance group Cappella, looked terrible. He was gasping for breath and his face was pale. “Marcus would never usually have gone on TV without having done his hair and had a shave,” Wynter says.\\nBreathing heavily from his intensive care unit bed at Royal Stoke university hospital, Birks told the BBC interviewer that he had been wrong about Covid-19. “If you haven’t been ill,” he said, “you don’t think you’re going to get ill, so you listen to the [anti-vaccine] stuff.” He spoke of his regret at not being vaccinated. “First thing I am going [to] tell all my family to do is get the vaccine and [then] anybody I see,” he said. “And as soon as I can get it, I am definitely getting it.”\\nBirks had rejected the vaccine because he thought it had been rushed through. “He thought it was an emergency vaccine,” says Wynter, “and he wanted to wait it out a little bit, before taking it.” Birks was the sort of person who was always “very anti putting anything in his body at all”, Wynter says. He wouldn’t drink or touch drugs – he wouldn’t even take paracetamol for a headache. And besides, Birks was a fitness enthusiast, going to the gym five times a week, so he figured that if he got Covid, he would most likely be fine.\\nWatching his interview, Wynter had never been so proud of his best friend. “It takes a lot of balls to stand up there and admit that maybe you made the wrong decision and had the wrong views,” he said. He texted Birks straight away. “I’m really proud of you mate, you’re a hero.” Birks responded from his hospital bed: “Thanks man, that was mad.”\\nMatt Wynter (centre) with Lis and Marcus Birks.\\nBirks never got a chance to get out of hospital and get vaccinated. He died on 27 August, aged 40. He left behind his wife and musical partner, Lis, who is pregnant with their first child. (Wynter is speaking with Lis’s blessing.) “I have never experienced grief like it,” says Wynter.\\nI\\nn the UK and other developed nations such as France and the US, Covid-19 has become a pandemic of the unvaccinated. Last month, Prof Chris Whitty, England’s chief medical officer, tweeted that: “The majority of our hospitalised Covid patients are unvaccinated and regret delaying [their vaccines].” About 60% of all hospitalisations due to Covid in the UK are of unvaccinated people. An Office for National Statistics report published on Monday says that in the first six months of 2021, Covid was involved in 37.4% of deaths in unvaccinated people – and just 0.8% of deaths in fully vaccinated people.\\nWhile 80% of the UK adult population is fully vaccinated (and 89% have received a first dose, indicating they will go on to be fully vaccinated), vaccine uptake rates have been tapering off in virtually all regions of the UK. For months, healthcare professionals have been sounding the alarm about the unvaccinated people they’re treating for Covid-19. “What we are seeing right now,” says Dr David Windsor, a critical care consultant working with Covid-19 patients in south-west England, “is a large number of unvaccinated people coming into hospital – far more than we would expect.”\\nWindsor tells me that he hasn’t had a single death of a vaccinated person in his unit in the past month. “I’ve seen hundreds of patients,” he says, “who would normally have succumbed to Covid, who have survived because they’re double-vaccinated.” By contrast, the unvaccinated patients he’s treating are sometimes in their 20s and 30s, and desperately sick. “It’s emotionally a really hard thing,” Windsor says, “when you know this disease can be prevented. Especially for the nursing staff, who are with these patients for 12 hours at a time. It’s heartbreaking.”\\nFor the most part, when an unvaccinated person dies of Covid-19, their families grieve privately. It is not hard to see why: the internet is a callous place. Social media trolls greet the death of unvaccinated people with jubilant celebration, as if they themselves never made a bad judgment call. Trolls congregate on the Facebook page of an unvaccinated Bournemouth solicitor, Leslie Lawrenson, who died of Covid-19 after uploading videos claiming that Covid-19 was “nothing to be afraid of”. “The world is a slightly better place now,” one user writes. “Would you look at that!” crows another. “Natural selection.” There is even a Reddit community, r/HermanCainAward, named for the former Republican presidential candidate who died of Covid-19 after opposing mask mandates. Its 138,000 members swap stories in triumphalist tones about unvaccinated people who died of Covid-19.\\nBirks, too, has been the subject of online sniping. “Anti-vaxxer musician dies from Covid” read a headline on Mail Online. “People need to show empathy for the situation,” Wynter says. “Just because someone has an opinion on something doesn’t mean they deserve the worst thing to happen to them. There are thousands of people who don’t agree with vaccinations. That doesn’t mean this should happen to them. I never met a person who would put people before himself more than Marcus. He was the one person who would be with you through thick and thin.”\\nDespite the gloating misanthropes, some people are speaking out about the deaths of their Covid-sceptic friends and relatives, in the hope of encouraging unvaccinated people to ignore social media misinformation and get vaccinated. “If even a few people get vaccinated because of what I say,” says Wynter, “then it’s worth it.” It is, after all, what Birks would have wanted. “I know,” Wynter says, “the reason he did that interview was because he wanted people to see how serious it was, and how real it was, and he had no pride in admitting that he should have taken the vaccine. And he didn’t want anyone else to make the same mistake that he did.”\\nJ\\naden (not his real name), a 44-year-old business owner from the West Midlands, wasn’t an anti-vaxxer, even if later in life he would sometimes associate with them at the anti-lockdown rallies he attended before he died of Covid-19. “He was a gentle giant,” says his wife, Priti, 41, a commercial director. “Caring. He’d listen to people. He wouldn’t necessarily agree with them, but he’d listen.” They had been married for 20 years, and had two sons. (At her sons’ request, Priti is speaking under a pseudonym.)\\nJaden was a loving, free-spirited, family-oriented man. He practised yoga and meditation, seldom drank alcohol, and ate a mostly plant-based diet. “I don’t want to call him a hippy,” Priti says, “but he was edging towards it.” He once took an online quiz to determine his political beliefs and came out as a libertarian.\\nWhen the pandemic began, Jaden’s counter-establishment beliefs widened from a hairline fracture into a vertiginous fissure. A major reason for his disenchantment with government policy was the fact that he was excluded from most support, as was Priti, because they were limited-company directors. “It impacted him heavily,” Priti says. “We’d worked forever and paid loads of taxes and didn’t get anything.” This, says Prof Karen Douglas of the University of Kent, is a routine driver of conspiratorial beliefs. “Feeling alienated and disenfranchised is associated with greater belief in conspiracy theories,” she says. “People tend to believe in conspiracy theories when they lack power, are part of a minority group, or are disadvantaged.”\\nOn social media, Jaden began to post anti-lockdown messages. In May 2020, he described the lockdown restrictions in a Facebook post as the “worst interference in personal liberties [in] our history”; in September and October, he attended anti-lockdown protests alongside figures such as the conspiracy theorist Piers Corbyn. “Electrifying energy!”, he captioned a picture of the crowd at the protest.\\nJaden refused to wear a mask, meaning that Priti did the shopping. “He was an anti-masker,” says Priti. “I’m not going to lie.” Jaden felt the government didn’t have the right to make people wear masks, and that it had equivocated on its position on mask-wearing. (After initially disputing the evidence on masks, the government made face masks compulsory on public transport and in NHS hospitals in England and Wales on 15 June 2020.) “One of the most important factors in social influence,” says Douglas, “especially when a smaller group is trying to persuade the majority to do something, is to be consistent in the message. When inconsistencies creep into an argument, it’s less likely that the masses will be persuaded.”\\nJaden did believe the pandemic was real. “But he didn’t approve of the masks and the chopping and changing by the government, and being told what to do,” Priti says. Jaden believed that if he got Covid-19, he would be fine. Priti does not think he would have taken the vaccine, had it been offered to him. (He died before the rollout reached his age group.)\\nAfter Jaden fell ill with Covid-19 in January, his perspective shifted. One day Priti found him on the sofa, browsing face masks on his phone. “He said: ‘This Ted Baker mask looks nice, I’ll get this one,’” remembers Priti. On social media, Jaden was repentant. “For the past 10 months,” he wrote on Facebook in January, “those of you that have stayed connected to me have seen posts that can now be described as grossly wrong on the subject of lockdowns, masks, and restrictions … I apologise to all those that I have offended and argued with. If you are still in the Covid-19 hoax or Covid overreaction camp, please believe the virus is painfully real.”\\nJaden died of Covid-19 in February 2021. Priti believes that, had he recovered, he would have had the vaccine. She is talking with me in the hope of encouraging others to get the jab. “He was scared,” says Priti of his final days. “He didn’t want to die.”\\nB\\neing young, fit and health-conscious; politically engaged; a free thinker; excluded from government support; headstrong and opinionated. If there was a bingo scorecard for the type of people likely to reject mask mandates and vaccinations, Jaden and Birks would get a full house.\\n“What tends to underpin conspiracy theories and beliefs,” says Dr Susannah Kola-Palmer, an expert in health psychology at the University of Huddersfield, “is that they come from a place of strong emotion, be that resentment, discontent, or fear.” She tells me that anti-vaxxers or vaccine-hesitant people tend to be far-left or far-right politically, have lower trust in authority, get most of their Covid information from social media, and score lower on civic responsibility tests.\\nAnother crucial reason why people may reject vaccinations: “They have lower benefit perceptions,” says Kola-Palmer, “meaning they are less likely to believe that the vaccine will be beneficial to them.” It is not that men such as Jaden and Birks believed the fruitier (and often antisemitic) conspiracy theories. They did not think that Covid-19 was a hoax, or a scheme by evil overlords to microchip the global population. But they did fatally miscalculate the risk-benefit ratio of vaccination versus non-vaccination. “When you’re young, fit and healthy,” says Wynter, “you think you can get through anything. You don’t realise how fragile life is, and how it can be gone so quickly.”\\nJaden and Birks exhibited optimism bias: our tendency to believe that negative events in the future are less likely to happen to us than the real-world data suggests. “People tend to take in and encode positive information about their own future more than negative information,” is how Prof Tali Sharot, a cognitive neuroscientist at University College London, puts it.\\nImagine that you are a 60-year-old woman and you read online that women are less likely to fall ill from Covid than men. “You think to yourself,” says Sharot, “well, my likelihood is not as high as I thought.” But if you also read that people in their 60s are more vulnerable to Covid, you discount this information, telling yourself that you work out and eat healthily and are unlikely to get sick. “It’s not that you’re totally ignoring the negative information,” says Sharot. “It’s just that you’re putting less weight on the negatives than the positives.”\\nThere is a reason that about half of the 20% of the population who do not exhibit optimism bias are clinically depressed, and the other half probably have a predisposition to depression, but just don’t know it yet. Optimism is a protective carapace that shields us from the chaotic unpredictability of the world. It is the mantra that bad things can and do happen, but not to me, or the people I love. Optimism bias enables us to embrace all of the things that make life worth living – falling in love, having children, going on holiday, swimming in the sea – without becoming consumed by the certainty that our partners will die and our children will be abducted by paedophiles and our plane will be hijacked by terrorists before we are finally eaten by sharks. “Optimism bias is necessary,” says Sharot. “It keeps us healthy and keeps us going.”\\nOptimism bias is a gift. Optimism bias keeps us happy, healthy, and sane. Optimism bias keeps us alive – most of the time. But for Jaden and Birks, optimism bias was a fatal miscalculation.\\nO\\nptimism bias can help explain why some people reject vaccines. But this is not to say that we should entirely let these vaccine-refusers off the hook. There are many people who can’t get vaccinated for health reasons, and every healthy person who rejects vaccination imperils the wellbeing of others, by further enabling the virus to spread. Priti is vaccinated, but she defends the rights of others to reject vaccines – some of the people in her life aren’t vaccinated, even after knowing what happened to Jaden. “It’s their personal choice,” she says, sounding fatigued. “I can’t be bothered to be angry with them. Because what’s the point? It’s not going to make me feel better.”\\nThere is clear daylight between vaccine-hesitant people such as Jaden and Birks, and full-blown anti-vaxxers. When anti-vaxxers fall ill with Covid-19, the public’s reserves of sympathy are justifiably limited: these are, after all, people who often proselytise misinformation about vaccination to impressionable people, encouraging them to reject medical science in favour of quack cures such as ivermectin or bleach.\\nIn the US, the influential podcaster Joe Rogan has touted the controversial ivermectin as a treatment for Covid-19, while people have been hospitalised after drinking disinfectant at the suggestion of Donald Trump. Closer to home, the anti-vaxxer conspiracy theorist and ex-nurse Kate Shemirani has suggested that NHS staff should be executed like Nazi war criminals for their role in carrying out vaccinations, has shared antisemitic misinformation about the origins of the pandemic, which she puts down to a shadowy global cabal seeking to control the world population, and has compared public health restrictions to the Holocaust. GPs have faced abuse from bellicose anti-vaxxers who turn up at surgeries to confront staff providing the vaccine, even going so far as to accuse them of war crimes, and BBC reporters have received death threats and been harassed in the street by people who think Covid-19 is a giant hoax.\\nBut it is the stories of these hardened anti-vaxxers that can possibly do the most to shift perceptions among their friends, family and peers. “We know some good will come out of this for sure,” says Mark Valentine, a 65-year-old trial consultant from Wendell, North Carolina. His brother, the Nashville, Tennessee-based conservative radio talkshow host Phil Valentine, died from Covid-19 in August, aged 61. “We have had dozens of people who have written in to tell us they got vaccinated as a result of what happened to Phil.\\n“People would love nothing better than to dance on his grave because he was an anti-vax person,” adds Mark. “But there’s no evidence to support that.” Now it is true that Phil did suggest that people with underlying conditions should get vaccinated, but this nuance may have been lost on his listeners, who heard Phil rail against mask mandates, compare the vaccination status badges worn by medical personnel to the yellow stars pressed on Jewish people in Nazi Germany, and even perform a parody song, Vaxman, set to the tune of the Beatles’ 1966 song Taxman.\\nPhil Valentine at a Tea Party rally in Nashville, Tennessee, in 2019. Photograph: Larry McCormack/AP\\nHowever, before he died, Phil repented. He sent a message to his brother from his hospital bed, asking him to undo his calamitous legacy. “He recognised the fact that, as an influential media person, a lot of people probably didn’t get vaccinated because he didn’t,” says Mark. “And he regretted that until the day he died. That’s why he asked me to go out and do what I could, to fix it. He said: ‘If I could go out there right now, I would tell people I made the wrong decision. I should have had the vaccination and I didn’t.’”\\n“Anecdotes and personal narratives are emotional appeals, and as such they can be helpful,” says Kola-Palmer. In general, she adds, people don’t respond well when you put the fear of God into them, or bombard them with data. What is better is “trying to meet a person where they are. Finding out if there are fears or worries that underpin their attitude, finding common ground, and building a dialogue from there.”\\nMark is a gregarious and charming presence who is sincerely doing his best to clean up his brother’s mess; he tells me that he knows of at least 20 people from his local community who have been vaccinated as a result of Phil’s death. But speaking with him also demonstrates how partisan the vaccination issue is in the US. An August NBC News poll found that only 55% of Republicans are vaccinated, compared with 88% of Democrats. “The whole thing is politicised,” says Mark. “And it’s costing people their lives, most recently, my brother.”\\nBut he refuses to condemn Republican lawmakers who have pushed anti-mask policies. He repeatedly references the inaccurate claim that illegal immigration on the southern border is to blame for exponential growth of the highly transmissible Delta variant, alleges the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is putting out inaccurate data, and tells me that “Biden has spread more Covid … than anybody on Earth”. A well-meaning person in a vortex of misinformation, Mark illustrates the real-world difficulties of extricating an entire cohort of people – only 46% of Trump-supporting Republicans are vaccinated – from what increasingly resembles a death cult.\\nMark, at least, got vaccinated after his brother’s death, and is urging others to do the same. But there are some people who will never come out of the misinformation whorl, not even on their deathbeds. “I asked him,” says Kayleigh Michelle Stein, 22, a waitress from Erie, Kansas, recounting a conversation she had with her father, Michael Stein, as he lay in hospital, “‘When you pull through this, will you get the shot?’ And he told me that he would not.”\\nKayleigh is newly orphaned. Michael, who was 53 and worked as a truck driver, and his wife, Michelle, also a 53-year-old truck driver, died of Covid-19 on 13 August. Both were unvaccinated. Before he died, Michael had described Covid-19 as “one big sham to keep us all in fear” in a Facebook post, and shared offensive memes about vaccination. “He believed that it was the government putting the tracking chip in people,” says Kayleigh. “And he was worried about it making him sick.” He had absorbed these messages on long truck journeys down rural roads, often late at night. “Pretty much all he did was drive down the road,” Kayleigh says, “listening to news stations on the radio.”\\nMichael had underlying health issues – he’d had heart attacks – and, as someone in his 50s, he was exactly the sort of person the vaccine was designed to protect. “It was political, pretty much,” says Kayleigh. “He was a full-blown Republican.” Nothing could disabuse her father of his anti-vaccination views, not even impending death. He is an extreme example of how some anti-vaxxers will die in the service of their beliefs, steadfastly rejecting medical science even as their breath grows more laboured and the look in their doctors’ eyes more grave.\\nDied on the same day ... Michelle and Michael Stein. Photograph: Facebook\\n“We definitely see a lot of regret,” Windsor tells me, of his patients in south-west England. “People who regret not being vaccinated when they come in. But not everybody feels that way. There are some people who disagree with us. They refuse to believe they have Covid. They put their shortness of breath down to other conditions. They say that they don’t need to go on ventilators, because they’ll be fine. We know that won’t be the case.” Attempting to remonstrate with these people, says Kola-Palmer, is a futile endeavour. “Those who are very entrenched in anti-vaccine beliefs,” she says, “we may never reach. But for those who are unsure or hesitant, with empathic listening and correction of misinformation, you might get there.”\\nWho is to blame for this mess? The social media companies, for not doing enough to stamp out misinformation? National governments, for not better communicating the importance of mask-wearing and vaccination? Conspiracy theorists who push dangerous misinformation for the dopamine rush of online validation and peer-group affirmation? Or individuals, for making bad choices that imperil the health of others? “There’s more than enough blame to go around,” Mark observes, correctly. Kayleigh is sanguine. “A part of me is mad,” she says. “I wish my parents were here, of course. But I also believe in not making people do things they don’t believe in.”\\nWhen everything is said and done, when the jeering online commenters drift away and the anger dissipates, all that is left is sadness. It is the emotion in unvaccinated patients’ eyes as doctors prepare to intubate them; it is the hand-wringing in waiting rooms as relatives prepare for bad news. “My biggest regret is not realising how sick he was,” says Wynter. “I could have been there more. That goes through my head a lot, if I’m honest with you.” Phil spent his last days consumed by terror that the damage he had done could not be unwrought. “He was full of regret,” says Mark of his brother. “He got it wrong and he should have got the vaccination.”\\nHe sighs. “That’s why I’m trying to mitigate the damage.”',\n",
       "  'More than 100m Covid vaccine doses are due to expire and be “thrown away” unless global leaders urgently share surplus supplies with the world’s poorest countries, Gordon Brown has warned.\\nThe “staggering” number of stockpiled “use now” jabs will be of no use to anyone by December, according to a new report from the research group Airfinity.\\nThe former prime minister said the failure of Boris Johnson, Joe Biden and EU leaders to agree on a plan to distribute the spare doses meant the world was facing a “vaccine waste disaster”.\\nBrown has sent Airfinity’s research to leading politicians, including the US president, the UK prime minister, and senior figures in Brussels, before a global vaccine summit on Wednesday.\\nAirfinity said its research predicted that by the end of this month, 7bn vaccine doses would be available around the world, rising to 12bn by December.\\nBrown said the crucial issue was how and where the vaccines would be distributed, warning that there was no agreement on who would provide the vaccines to poor countries by December. Unless a plan was drawn up urgently, he said, lives would be lost needlessly.\\n“We need a vaccine release plan to provide ‘use now’ vaccines to prevent a vaccine waste disaster because ‘use by’ dates are missed,” he said.\\n“It is unthinkable and unconscionable that 100 million vaccines will have to be thrown away from the stockpiles of the rich countries while the populations of the world’s poorest countries will pay for our vaccine waste in lives lost.\\n“It will be a profound and collective political tragedy if this summit misses the opportunity to act, with doses transferred immediately to poorer countries.”\\nThe campaign group Global Justice Now said wasting millions of doses of Covid vaccines would be an “atrocity” when they could be used in poorer countries.\\nIts director, Nick Dearden, said: “Rich countries like the UK are hoarding vaccines that are desperately needed in low- and middle-income countries.\\n“Poorer countries shouldn’t have to wait until our doses are about to expire to vaccinate their populations. Many are capable of safely manufacturing vaccines, if only we would waive intellectual property, so vaccines can be produced patent-free in the countries that need them most.”\\nLast month, the director general of the World Health Organisation (WHO), Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, called for a global pause of Covid vaccine booster programmes until at least the end of the year to allow all countries to get more of their populations vaccinated.\\nTedros said there should not be widespread use of third doses for healthy people who were already double-jabbed.\\nCovax, a programme backed by the WHO to help distribute jabs to developing countries, has cut its forecast of deliveries of doses by a quarter for this year.\\nSpeaking before Wednesday’s summit, Brown added: “The Airfinity report is a guide for world leaders to fix a more ambitious action plan. It shows we have enough vaccines either on shelves or in production even to vaccinate 70% of the global population by May next year.\\n“Global political leaders must match the extraordinary commitment and cooperation of scientists and manufacturers who have created the opportunity to vaccinate the entire world.”',\n",
       "  'I listened with incredulity to the press conference given by the health secretary last Wednesday (MPs should set example in battle against Covid, says Sajid Javid. 20 October). At no point was there consideration of how housebound people such as my elderly mother can receive their Covid booster vaccinations, or indeed their flu vaccinations. Such people are very vulnerable to infection, not least because many are reliant on peripatetic carers. Sajid Javid said there are sufficient booster vaccines for those who are eligible and that there are resources to ensure delivery. This is not entirely true.\\nIt is now over seven months since my mother had her second Covid jab. We have been battling since mid-September to get a booster vaccine delivered; 119 handlers tell me that it is the responsibility of GPs to ensure booster vaccinations are delivered to the housebound and they cannot help. Our GP surgery has simply had my mother on a “housebound list” for the last six weeks. That list has just been shared with the community team – district nurses who are extremely busy with their normal duties. I have no faith that a Covid booster or a flu vaccination will be delivered to my mother or other housebound patients any time soon. Sajid Javid needs to urgently explore what is happening on the ground and get a grip on this issue.\\nAlison Coote\\nSevenoaks, Kent\\nAt his press conference, Sajid Javid said: “We’ve got the jabs, we just need the arms to put them in.” This is just not true. Earlier last week, I tried to book my booster jab on the dedicated 119 number. I was told, rightly, to wait a couple of days as it wasn’t quite six months since my second jab. When I rang back on the correct day, the required time lapse had mysteriously become “six months plus one week”.\\nIt is bad enough that this government won’t mandate even the most basic prevention measures that are in use all over Europe. To put all our eggs in the booster vaccination basket, without telling us they haven’t even bothered to fill that basket, is something else again.\\nDr John Read\\nLondon\\nLast Friday morning I received a text from the NHS advising me to book my booster vaccine as I am “at increased risk of complications from Covid-19”. It is six months since my second dose of vaccine. When I rang 119 to book, I was told that although I am eligible for a booster jab, I will have to call again to book in some “days or weeks”, because there is a shortage of vaccines. The call handler was unable to tell me how long it might be before they become available.\\nGovernment figures have been blaming the public for not booking our vaccines. Yet it now seems that the low rollout of the booster vaccine is due to a vaccine shortage that’s not being reported or rectified.\\nJane Spencer\\nExminster, Devon\\nA slow uptake of booster jabs is not due to recipients not wanting the vaccine. It is because of the difficulty of older people getting to centralised sites. My partner’s mother lives in north Oxfordshire and is 97. When she got a letter inviting her to go for a booster, she rang up and was offered an out-of-town site in Oxford (25 miles away) or Reading. Some local sites are beginning to open and my partner eventually found a place in Banbury offering vaccines, but couldn’t get an appointment until mid-November.\\nMike Williams\\nSwindon, Wiltshire\\nHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

       "  'Sign up for the Week in Patriarchy, a newsletter on feminism and sexism sent every Saturday\\nIt’s about bloody time health experts listened to women\\nCould the Covid-19 vaccine have a short-term impact on your menstrual cycle? Thousands of women think so: ever since the vaccines became widely available, people who menstruate have been sharing stories about weird changes to their cycle following their shots. More than 30,000 reports of post-vaccine menstrual irregularity have been made to the UK’s medical regulator alone. In the US, researchers Kate Clancy and Katharine Lee have collected more than 140,000 reports from people who have noticed a change in their period post-vaccination.\\nFor the most part, these concerns have been brushed off by health experts. Nothing to see here, the message basically was. Periods are often irregular! Now, however, the medical establishment is finally admitting that maybe all those women weren’t just making things up after all. This week the BMJ published a report by Dr Victoria Male, a lecturer in reproductive immunology at Imperial College London, noting that a link between the vaccine and menstrual changes was “plausible and should be investigated”. In the US, the National Institutes of Health recently awarded $1.67m to five research institutions to explore potential links between Covid-19 vaccination and menstrual changes.\\nLet me be very clear: overwhelming evidence shows that the Covid-19 vaccines are safe and effective. There are lots of non-alarming reasons why the vaccine might temporarily affect your cycle. Dr Male’s report, for example, notes that any link is probably the result of an immune response to the vaccination, rather than anything in the vaccine itself. While this still needs to be studied, previous studies show that the menstrual cycle can be affected by immune activation. Dr Male further notes that most people who report a change to their period after vaccination find it only lasts one cycle. There’s also no evidence that there is any effect on fertility.\\nThere is no reason to be worried by a possible link between the Covid-19 vaccine and an abnormal period. What is worrying, however, is the abysmal way in which the issue has been handled. First, there’s the fact that participants in clinical coronavirus vaccine trials weren’t asked specific questions about changes to their menstrual cycle. Why did no one think that might be something worth collecting data on? Dr Kathryn Edwards, a professor who sits on an independent data monitoring committee for the Pfizer vaccine, told NPR earlier this year that the accelerated speed of development of the vaccines meant that everyone’s energy was focused on spotting dangerous side effects. “I want people to understand that we’re not blowing them off,” Edwards told NPR, “but we have some priorities that we have to have.”\\nHere’s the thing though: building trust in a vaccine should be at the top of the list of priorities. Approximately 26% of people in the world are actively menstruating. A data gap surrounding such a large population is a breeding ground for misinformation. While the medical establishment has ignored or dismissed links between vaccines and menstruation, plenty of armchair experts have been busy spreading dangerous conspiracy theories about. “Vaccine hesitancy among young women is largely driven by false claims that Covid-19 vaccines could harm their chances of future pregnancy,” Dr Male wrote in the BMJ. “Failing to thoroughly investigate reports of menstrual changes after vaccination is likely to fuel these fears.” Of course it is.\\nYou know what really makes me see red? All the excuses that have come up recently about how difficult it is to study whether vaccines might cause menstrual disruptions. “The menstrual cycle itself is just so incredibly difficult to study, because there are so many other things that may impact it,” one (female) expert told NPR, for example. I’m sure it is difficult! But so is going to Mars. Nobody seems to shrug their shoulders about that and say “nah, too hard”. That sort of defeatist attitude seems to pop up a lot when it comes to women’s health, however. I hope this pandemic does something to change that. Recent months have been a painful reminder that it doesn’t matter how amazing a vaccine is; it’s only effective if enough people take it. And if you want to have any hope of that happening, then the medical industry needs to start taking women seriously.\\nCara Delevingne wants to ‘peg the patriarchy’\\nThe model (who comes from an extremely well-connected aristocratic family) turned up at the Met gala wearing a white vest emblazoned with the phrase.

       "  'A coronavirus jab based on traditional vaccine technology might be as effective as the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, data suggests, offering new hope for global vaccination efforts.\\nVaccines currently approved for use in the UK deliver instructions for producing the coronavirus “spike” protein to cells in order, which triggers an immune response. However, the jab produced by the French pharmaceutical company Valneva involves delivering the whole – but inactivated – Sars-CoV-2 virus.\\nLast month the government cancelled its contract with Valneva, which included an order for about 100m doses of the vaccine, over an alleged breach of the agreement.\\nNot only has it been suggested that inactivated whole-virus vaccines may result in a broader immune response, but the approach could also help to maintain protection in the face of new variants. This is because it is unlikely that mutations will crop up at the same time in multiple proteins of the virus.\\nThe Valneva jab is also stable when stored in a standard refrigerator, making it easier to distribute than the Covid vaccines, which require shipping and storage at ultra-low temperatures.\\nResults released by Valneva on Monday suggest that the Covid vaccine may trigger a stronger immune response than the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab.\\nProf Adam Finn of the University of Bristol, the trial’s chief investigator, said that it was not ethically possible to compare the Valneva jab against a placebo, meaning efficacy could not be measured. Instead the vaccine was compared in a head-to-head trial against the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab.\\nThe phase 3 study, dubbed “Cov-Compare”, involved 4,012 participants aged 18 years and older across 26 trial sites in the UK.\\nThe 1,040 participants under 30 were given two doses of the Valneva jab 28 days apart, while the remaining participants, aged 30 and over, were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive two doses of either the Valneva jab or the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine.\\nThe results from 990 participants aged 30 or over – about half of whom were given each jab – suggest the Valneva Covid vaccine, VLA2001, triggered about 40% higher levels of neutralising antibodies on average than the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine.\\nLike the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, the Valneva jab was found to stimulate responses from other components of the immune system, including T-cells. However, the Valneva jab gave rise to T-cells able to respond not only to the coronavirus spike protein, but to two other key proteins.\\nThe team found fewer side-effects were reported in those given the Valneva jab. However, fewer than 1% of participants given either jab reported an “adverse event of special interest”, while no participants developed a severe Covid infection.\\n“Participants in the younger age group vaccinated with VLA2001 showed an overall safety profile comparable to the older age group,” the team add.\\nFinn said it would take observational studies to confirm just how effective the Valneva jab was against Covid, an approach that has previously been used to evaluate meningitis B jabs.\\n“The efficacy of a vaccine is not proportional to the antibody titres that it generates,” he said, noting that it was thought there was a threshold above which one was protected. “It’s about having enough antibody, rather than just looking at how much antibody there is, and imagining that tells you how well [the jab will] work,” he said.\\nNonetheless, Finn said, the results were “very encouraging”.\\n“The immunogenicity [data] would suggest that it will be at least as effective and potentially more effective than the Oxford vaccine, which sets a really good precedent, because that vaccine is highly effective against severe disease, as is the Pfizer vaccine.”\\nWhile the integrity of the Valneva study data is now undergoing validation, the team hope the jab will be approved by the UK’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency by the end of the year.\\nDr Juan Carlos Jaramillo, the chief medical officer for Valneva, said the company was initially seeking approval for its Covid jab for people aged 18-55, adding that trials were ongoing among older adults. Recruitment has begun for trials involving older children, while the team is also exploring use of the jab as boosters.\\nOnce approved, the jab could be considered by the World Health Organization. Jaramillo said the company was in discussions with Covax, the global vaccine-sharing initiative.\\nThe jab could prove particularly useful in countries where ultra-low-temperature storage is hard to come by, but Finn suggested it may also bring benefits elsewhere, noting that the traditional technology might be more acceptable to those who have been reluctant to receive a Covid jab because of concerns over newer vaccine platforms.',\n",
       "  'A majority of Australians would be comfortable with venues requiring patrons to be vaccinated as a condition of entry, and for jabs to be mandatory in a range of employment and leisure settings, according to the latest Guardian Essential poll.\\nThe latest survey of 1,100 respondents also indicates that only 26% understand and approve of the four-phase plan to reopen Australia once vaccination rates rise to 70 and 80% of adults – with 54% either saying they don’t understand the plan to wind back restrictions, or they do understand it but lack confidence in it.\\nThe new poll shows mandatory vaccinations are supported for Australia’s health and disability care workers (83% and 82% of respondents approve). A further 77% of respondents think vaccines should be compulsory for airline travellers, and 74% think teachers and teacher’s aides should be inoculated before working at schools.\\nResidents of Sydney’s Covid hotspots call out ‘double standard’ of recreation rules\\nRead more\\nMajorities also support vaccinations as a condition of entry to sporting events (69%) and hospitality and entertainment venues (68%), while 62% agree mandatory jabs should be required for people to return to work at the workplace. Smaller majorities (58%) support mandatory vaccinations for students to attend school and for customers to shop at retail stores after lockdowns end.\\nWhile compulsion is supported, Australians are divided over who should implement and enforce the mandates. The largest cohort (45%) think the Morrison government should coordinate uniform laws across the states, while 25% think that should be left to the states, and 31% believe employers should be able to exercise their own judgments.\\nDespite the national reopening plan being front-and-centre in political debate both federally and within the federation for the best part of a month, many Australians remain uncertain about the transition to living with Covid. A significant number of voters are cautious or confused, and 20% of respondents say they are not aware of the reopening plan at all.\\nRespondents are also concerned about the stress that easing restrictions will put on the health and hospital systems. More than half of respondents (55%) say their state’s public health system is already struggling to cope and will be overwhelmed by any surge in Covid hospitalisations during the Delta outbreak – with concern about that risk highest in New South Wales.\\nMore than half of respondents (53%) express concern that Scott Morrison is advocating easing restrictions without paying enough attention to hospital capacity.\\nNSW unvaccinated could be denied freedoms at 80% target, premier says, as 1,257 Covid cases recorded\\nRead more\\nConsistent with the inclination among survey respondents in favour of mandatory vaccination, more people (39%) in the sample even believe that vaccinated Covid patients should be prioritised for medical attention over unvaccinated people (34% express disagreement with that view).\\nViews about the national plan vary depending on where respondents live.\\nIn NSW – where the premier, Gladys Berejiklian, has been the strongest promoter of the proposal – 32% of state-based respondents say they understand the plan and have confidence in it, while 38% report understanding the plan but lacking confidence in it. In Victoria, fewer people support the plan (26%) and more people understand it but lack confidence in it (43%).\\nIn the states not battling outbreaks, support for the reopening plan is lower (23% in both Queensland and Western Australia).\\nThe percentage of respondents saying they understand the plan but lack confidence in it sits at 35% in Queensland and 41% in WA. State-based respondent breakdowns involve small sample sizes, so caution is warranted.\\nPremiers continuing to use state border closures as an infection control measure once the number of vaccinated Australian adults rises divides the Guardian Essential sample. But again, the results suggest voters are cautious.\\nA significant minority of respondents, 41%, say states with low or no Covid-19 cases should be allowed to keep their borders closed for as long as they think is necessary – while 37% say they would be comfortable with borders reopening in states with low or no cases but only once 80% of the population aged over 16 is fully vaccinated.\\nAgain, views vary depending on where respondents live. Majorities of Guardian Essential respondents in Queensland (55%) and WA (67%) believe Annastacia Palaszczuk and Mark McGowan should shut state borders for as long as they think is necessary.\\nVoter views about reopening the international border are also hedged, with 34% of respondents agreeing with the statement: “We cannot accept any deaths that could be prevented by keeping our borders closed until it’s safe to reopen them”.\\nJust under half the sample (45%) agree with the statement: “We need to accept some deaths but must take every reasonable step to minimise deaths, even if it means slowing our reopening”. Only 20% of respondents are prepared to accept “some” deaths to normalise international travel because “the cost of remaining closed is too high”.\\nOnce again, community concern about the risks associated with normalising international travel is higher in WA and Queensland than in the states currently battling Delta outbreaks.\\nWhy is Australia at odds over the Doherty report and what does it say about opening up the country?\\nRead more\\nThe percentage of respondents in the survey saying they will never be vaccinated is now down to 6%. It has been as high as 16% in some surveys. But views towards easing restrictions for fully vaccinated people also vary.\\nJust under half of respondents (44%) think restrictions should only be relaxed when everyone has had the opportunity to get vaccinated, while 39% think vaccinated people should be given a leave pass from restrictions immediately, while 17% expresses the view that vaccinated and unvaccinated people should not be treated differently.\\nAs Delta cases have surged in NSW and Victoria, Berejiklian and Daniel Andrews have faced a slide in voter approval of their government’s handling of the pandemic in recent Guardian Essential surveys.\\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\\nBut as the debate has shifted from restrictions to the conditions required to reopen the country between now and the summer holidays, both governments have recovered some standing in the latest poll, with approval in NSW and Victoria up six points in a fortnight (from 40 to 46% in NSW and 44 to 50% in Victoria).\\nThese positive movements are outside the poll’s margin of error, which is plus or minus three points.\\nApproval of the Morrison government’s handling of the pandemic has also rallied (from 39% a fortnight ago to 43% this fortnight) – with 35% of the sample characterising the federal Coalition’s management as poor.\\nVoter sentiment has also improved for the Morrison government in NSW and Victoria over the past fortnight.',\n",
       "  'D\\neysia Padilla’s family thought she was at work. Instead, she spent last Thursday afternoon unloading a mound of orange and pink baby socks in a sunny South Bronx laundromat – one-by one, in all their three-inch glory. She had 48 hours to consider an impossible choice: either get vaccinated or lose her job.\\nPadilla is one of thousands of unvaccinated New Yorkers affected by Mayor Bill de Blasio’s ultimatum last week. Not only do city employees face the reality of losing their jobs, but without a shot, they’ll even forgo unemployment payments. Some unvaccinated Bronx natives would rather pursue a life outside New York City than be forced to take the vaccine.\\n“I feel like my dream is being shattered by the government,” said Padilla. “I’m being taken out of my home.” The 25-year-old mother had plans to become an art teacher one day. Now, she’s considering moving to Florida with her husband and three-month-old baby.\\nA pandemic-induced population shift to Florida – sometimes called the city’s sixth borough – is already under way. As of March, more than 33,500 New Yorkers permanently relocated to Florida – up 32% from the same period in the previous year. Experts say people flocked south for looser Covid restrictions, affordable housing, and access to in-person schools.\\nMost unvaccinated Bronx residents don’t fit neatly into the anti-mask, anti-vaccine framework that has spread nationally, according to Andrew Rasmussen, associate professor of psychology at Fordham University. The Bronx is still nursing its wounds after being hit tragically hard by the deadly virus – with the highest rates of hospitalizations, deaths and unemployment in New York City.\\nIn the Bronx, where median per capita income in 2019 was $21,778 – over three and a half times lower than in Manhattan – 70% of the population works in face-to-face or essential jobs. Even now, people wear masks – sometimes two – while walking outdoors. Many are still nervous to shake hands with people outside their family. Building custodians diligently stroll the sidewalks, spraying Clorox.\\n“People are wearing double-masks, being really careful, but the vaccination rates in the neighborhood are still very low,” said Rasmussen. “That suggests that there’s something else going on there.”\\nStill, it is not unusual to hear Bronx residents voice more concern about the vaccine than the virus it is administered to prevent.\\n“I worry about the virus, but more importantly, I worry about the vaccine,” said Kelven Esbenel, 24. Six weeks ago, he started work at an Amazon fulfilment center in Staten Island, only to learn that the company may start requiring vaccinations under Biden’s new mandates. Now, he said he ponders a life in Connecticut, leaving his vaccinated family members behind.\\n“We can’t expect that medical systems who have earned the mistrust of many marginalized groups will now be trusted because of Covid. It doesn’t work that way,” said Tiffany Green, a population health scientist and economist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\\nThis mistrust almost cost Emely Berrera, 23, her stepfather’s life. She works as a cashier at a hand car wash in the Tremont section of the West Bronx, and said her stepfather nearly stopped breathing last March. When the family called a taxi to get him to the hospital, the driver warned them, “Don’t go, because they’re gonna kill you in there.”\\nBerrera’s stepfather stayed home, where the family treated him with purple onion tea. Luckily he recovered.\\nMistrust of public institutions in the Bronx can be explained, in part, experts say, by steep barriers to medical care and a history of resource depletion after the borough’s white population dropped by 50% in the 1970s.\\n“There are policy prescriptions that people are expected to engage in, but there has been a transference away from marginalized and Black and brown folks in terms of resources,” said Lessie Branch, director of the Think Tank at Bronx-based Thinkubator. “As best as they can, they try to observe the policy prescriptions but without the accompanying resources to help them.”\\nA mural honoring healthcare workers at Montefiore medical center in the Bronx. Photograph: Timothy A Clary/AFP/Getty Images\\nResearch shows that having a trusted medical provider is an important predictor of likelihood to get the vaccine. The Bronx has the lowest number of general practitioners per 100,000 population of any borough in the city – five times lower than in Manhattan.\\n“In this local community, they see their pharmacist more than they see their doctor,” said Priyank Patel, a supervising pharmacist in Crotona. Patel said he was doing his best to make up for medical inequities by quelling misinformation with a familiar face and a few empathetic conversations.\\nWhen vaccines were introduced in January, Patel said, the pharmacy’s online slots were filled within 30 minutes – but not always by locals. Most Bronx residents could not afford to stay home from work. Instead, some Manhattanites raced to the Bronx earlier this year in search of the coveted vaccine appointments.\\nFor some, like Seth Hopper, the inoculation field trip was their first time in the borough.\\n“I never had been there before. It was the first location I could get when the vaccinations became available,” he said. Hopper traveled from his apartment on the Upper East Side in April to get vaccinated in Co-Op City, a massive housing cooperative in the north-east Bronx.\\nAs some Bronx natives consider moving out-of-state to avoid the shot, community leaders question the long-term effects of vaccine mandates on community trust.\\n“Overusing heavy-handed mandates that threaten people’s livelihoods is seen as cruel,” said Tom Sheppard, who serves on the city’s elected Community Education Council and is co-founder of Bronx Parent Leaders Advocacy Group, in a tweet. “You may even mean well, but doing it this way erodes trust instead of building it.”\\nPadilla looked up from the mound of socks that day. “It’s gonna get ugly,” she said. “I’m telling you.”',\n",

       "  'More than 100,000 lives can be saved in Africa by undertaking the emergency airlift of 240m unused vaccines in the next fortnight, Gordon Brown has urged.\\nThe former prime minister called on a group of rich nations to back “the biggest peacetime public policy decision” by supporting an October airlift that would see unused vaccines handed to parts of the global south struggling the most.\\nBrown is using his role as an adviser to the World Health Organization (WHO) to push for a more ambitious plan to deliver vaccines to Africa, amid continuing international concern over the shortage. With only 5% of the population vaccinated in Africa, Brown urged the leaders of the US, the EU, Canada and the UK to back an emergency airlift. He said that 40% of Covid deaths in Africa had happened since the start of August, making the need for action urgent.\\n“While vaccines have been pledged for donation from all donors, we are not getting the vaccines into people’s arms and urgently need a month-to-month timetable to meet our interim targets and prevent further loss of lives,” Brown told the Observer. “An immediate emergency airlift of 240m vaccines this month from the global north to the global south should be followed by the transfer of a further 760m vaccines transferred by February. This would be the biggest peacetime public policy decision, which could save 100,000 lives and prevent many of the one million Covid-induced deaths projected over the next year.”\\nHe said that sending excess vaccines to Covax, the international bulk-purchasing agency, is the best way of meeting the WHO target of vaccinating 40% of the global south by December and 70% by next summer.\\nAnalysis by research group Airfinity, which gives country-by-country figures for surplus vaccines, suggests that 100,000 lives could be saved with airlifts this month alone. Brown said its data showed 230m more could be transferred by the end November, 112m more in December, 280m more in January, and 240m more in February. These vaccines would be in addition to the vaccines already promised to Africa.\\nIt needs our political leaders to step up to the sign-off. Every passing day is a day lost in the battle to contain Covid\\nGordon Brown\\n“Vital time to contain Covid, stop mutations and save lives is being wasted,” Brown said. “It needs our political leaders to step up to the sign-off. Every passing day is a day lost in the battle to contain Covid and save lives. As long as health workers remain unvaccinated and the vulnerable elderly have no protection against Covid-19, deaths in the poorest countries will rise, and there the disease threatens to spread uninhibited in unprotected environments, giving rise to new variants that could eventually infect even the fully vaccinated.”\\nBrown, who is now a WHO ambassador for global health financing, is pressing Joe Biden, Ursula von der Leyen, Boris Johnson and Justin Trudeau to attend an emergency summit – ahead of the G20 meeting to be held in Rome at the end of this month – and agree the airlift, which could be under way within days. Brown has sent a briefing of his plans to US secretary of state Antony Blinken.\\nThere remain serious concerns that, as well as costing thousands of lives in Africa, allowing Covid to run rampant across the continent could lead to the emergence of new variants that escape the current vaccines created to contain it. Brown said he believed the mass transfer of unused vaccines around the globe could save a million lives over the next year.\\nThe project would require the nations involved to mobilise aircraft and ground support for an unparalleled distribution of vaccines to 92 low-income countries where deaths are rising and vaccination rates are at 5%. Brown said that Britain will have 55m surplus vaccines over the next four months, which could be transferred as part of an ambitious proposal to transfer £1.1bn unused vaccines between now and February.\\nHis intervention comes after President Biden announced more vaccine donations this week during a meeting with Kenyan leader Uhuru Kenyatta.',\n",

       "  'Plans to introduce vaccine passports across England next month have been shelved in a dramatic U-turn by the government, but Conservative opponents fear they could still be made mandatory later this year amid a warning the NHS faces “the worst winter in living memory”.\\nJust weeks after Boris Johnson announced the controversial documents would be necessary for fully vaccinated people to go to nightclubs and other crowded venues, Sajid Javid, the health secretary, said the policy had been suspended and would not go ahead from 1 October.\\nGovernment sources said dire warnings at the start of summer about Covid cases, hospitalisations and death levels as a result of the almost total lifting of restrictions had not been borne out, and that the success of the jabs rollout meant vaccine passports were not needed imminently.\\nJohnson will confirm the move on Tuesday, when he is expected to make a Commons statement and hold a press conference to prepare people for a difficult winter, with measures such as mask-wearing and social distancing possibly being reintroduced at a national or local level.\\nA senior Whitehall insider told the Guardian: “The prime minister doesn’t want any new measures but we can’t rule it out. If we don’t want another lockdown, we may have to use other options – the question is how explicit we want to be about what those will be.”\\nWith schools in England having just returned and the dual threat of Covid and flu filling hospitals, a start date for the programme of booster vaccines for people aged over 70 and frontline health and social care workers is also expected to be announced imminently.\\nThe UK’s medicines regulator last week granted emergency approval for the Pfizer/BioNTech and Oxford/AstraZeneca jabs to be used as third shots to tackle potentially waning immunity. However, the vaccine rollout advisory body is yet to say whether it has approved boosters, and if so on what scale.\\nBe prepared for winter Covid wave, Boris Johnson to warn\\nRead more\\nSeparately, ministers are also planning to scrap the requirement for travellers from some countries to take a PCR test on arrival to the UK, given the costs and knock-on effect it is having on the aviation and tourism industry, and instead allow them present a lateral flow result. The next review point of all rules governing international travel is 1 October, so a decision will be made closer to that point.\\nSpeculation is still building in Westminster that a cabinet reshuffle is imminent, with the chief whip, Mark Spencer, and Jack Doyle, No 10’s head of communications, spotted in Downing Street late on Sunday afternoon.\\nDespite Scotland pressing ahead with introducing vaccine passports from next month, Javid said on Sunday he “never liked the idea” but that it had been “right to properly look at it”.\\nIn an extraordinary volte-face, the health secretary had told Sky News he would not “rule it out” before declaring an hour later on the BBC: “What I can say is that we’ve looked at it properly, and while we should keep it in reserve as a potential option, I’m pleased to say we will not be going ahead with plans for vaccine passports.”\\nHe added: “I think it’s fair to say most people instinctively don’t like the idea. I’ve never liked the idea of saying to people, you must show your papers for … what is an everyday activity. But we were right to properly look at it, to look at the evidence.”\\nSome Tory MPs had assumed it was an empty threat, designed to drive up levels of vaccination uptake among young people. More than 40 of Johnson’s own backbenchers had publicly vowed to vote against making such documents a condition of entry to some venues – enough to wipe out the Conservatives’ substantial Commons majority.\\nLabour branded the backtrack the latest example of how the government’s approach to vaccine passports had been “shambolic from the start”. Angela Rayner, the party’s deputy leader, said ministers had never been clear about what they were meant to achieve, how they would work and how businesses should prepare to implement them. “This is the culmination of a summer of chaos from ministers and they urgently need to get a grip before winter,” she said.\\nIndustry figures also welcomed the news. Sacha Lord, the founder of Parklife festival and night-time economy adviser for Greater Manchester, called vaccine passports “untenable and illogical”, while the Music Venues Trust said there were serious issues of “deliverability, practicality, equality and potential discrimination”.\\nHowever, Conservative MPs remained wary that the government was simply pausing its introduction of vaccine passports. Mark Harper, the chair of the Covid Recovery Group of Tory MPs, said: “They shouldn’t be kept in reserve – they are pointless, damaging and discriminatory.” Another backbencher said: “The very concept of vaccine passports needs to be ruled out for good, as they are fundamentally unconservative, discriminatory and would lead to a two-tier society that I am confident no one actually wants to see.”\\nStephen Reicher, who advises the government on behavioural science, told the Guardian he hoped ministers had shelved the vaccine passports plan based on the scientific arguments against it, but admitted: “I don’t believe that, sadly it’s probably politics.”\\nHe said it may have quickened vaccine take-up among those already inclined to get jabbed, but would have had the adverse effect of alienating those who were hesitant. Reicher added: “If you don’t use vaccine passports, you’ve got to have something better. It really concerns me that the government haven’t done anything to make venues safe. There seems to be a lack of a winter plan.”\\nJonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, urged Johnson to provide details on Tuesday. He said: “We know that winter is going to be difficult. The NHS is fearing the worst winter in living memory. We know we’re going to have more flu, more respiratory problems, norovirus. So we need to prepare our NHS for winter.”',\n",

       "  'After months of uncertainty, the UK’s four chief medical officers have said that Covid-19 vaccinations can be offered to all 12-to-15-year-olds. How was the decision made, how will the vaccines be rolled out, and what difference will they make?\\nWhat were the UK’s chief medical officers asked?\\nMinisters asked the CMOs for advice on whether to offer Covid vaccines to healthy 12-to-15-year-olds. The government’s vaccine advisory group, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, felt the benefit was too marginal and recommended jabs only for clinically vulnerable children in that age group, or those living with people at high risk from the disease. The CMOs looked at the wider impact of vaccinating all 12-to-15-year-olds, particularly on their education.\\nWhat did the CMOs decide?\\nThe CMOs consulted a range of experts from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health to regional directors of public health before reaching a decision. They advised ministers to press on with Covid vaccinations for all children aged 12 to 15. With cases expected to rise through the autumn and winter, the CMOs believe the vaccinations will help reduce Covid transmission and outbreaks in schools that would bring further disruption to children’s education.\\nWhat will vaccination involve?\\nChildren in the age bracket will be offered a single shot of the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid vaccine. Further advice on any second doses will come from the JCVI once more data has been gathered internationally. If second shots get the green light, they will not be given before the spring term.\\nCovid jabs for 12- to 15-year-olds ‘set to start in weeks’ across UK\\nRead more\\nWhat difference will the jabs make?\\nA single shot of the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid vaccine is about 55% protective against Covid infection, and more so against hospitalisation and death, though severe Covid disease is rare in healthy children. So the vaccination programme will not stop Covid in schools, but should help to keep cases down and so reduce disruption from the disease.\\nHow will the rollout work?\\nCovid vaccines have already been given to clinically vulnerable children aged 12 to 15, or those living with others at high risk, at vaccine hubs around the country. The broader inoculation of 12- to 15-year-olds is expected to start imminently and run through the secondary school vaccination system.\\nAre schools up to the task?\\nIt will take some planning. Chief medical officers want Covid shots offered in much the same way as nasal spray flu vaccines are provided at schools, but the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine must be stored at extremely cold temperatures and requires an injection rather than a spray. To further complicate the process, some schools and colleges have already received threats of legal action if they offer Covid vaccines.\\nWhose decision is it?\\nUK law is the same for coronavirus vaccines as for other immunisations. When a vaccine is offered to 12-to-15-year-olds, doctors require parental consent, or the child’s own consent, if they are deemed competent enough to provide it.\\nWhat is the risk of side effects?\\nSome concern has been raised about rare side-effects from the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, in particular a condition called myocarditis, a swelling of the heart muscle that usually resolves after a few days of rest. Researchers are gathering data on the prevalence of the problem, but in the UK the rate of myocarditis after both first and second doses is six per million shots of Pfizer/BioNTech, according to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. The majority of cases seen so far appear after the second shot. Doctors point out that myocarditis can occur in Covid patients too, with one study suggesting that for male teenagers, the risk of myocarditis is six times higher from Covid than it is from the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.\\nWhat are other countries doing?\\nMany countries, such as the US, France, Spain, Italy and the Netherlands, are pressing ahead with Covid vaccines for children aged 12 and over in the hope that it will help to keep schools open. After positive clinical trials in younger children, the US-based FDA and other regulators are expected to approve the jabs for primary school-aged children soon.',\n",

Once federal regulators fully approve the vaccine for that group, the state will require students in seventh through 12th grades to get vaccinated in both public and private schools, the governor Gavin Newsom’s office said on Friday.\\nThe state will require the vaccine for students in kindergarten through sixth grade only after the federal government has given final approval for anyone 5 to 11.\\nThe California region where Covid ‘just isn’t slowing down’\\nRead more\\n“Our schools already require vaccines for measles, mumps and more. Why? Because vaccines work,” the governor said in a tweet. “This is about keeping our kids safe & healthy.”\\nCalifornia currently has the lowest Covid case rate in the country, although some regions, particularly those where resistance to vaccines and public health mandates remains high, are continuing to see a troubling surge in hospitalizations. Newsom, emboldened after easily defeating a recall effort last month, has emphasized his commitment to vaccine mandates to end the pandemic.\\nLos Angeles county has already mandated vaccines for all students 12 and over. In the nation’s largest school district, daily infections are down by half in the last month, when most kids went back to school.\\n“These numbers are amazingly low given that 3,000-plus schools are now open countywide,” said Barbara Ferrer, county health director, on Thursday.\\nThe state’s vaccine mandate would take effect the semester after the federal government grants final approval. If it comes in January, then the mandate would take effect in July.\\nStudents would be granted religious and medical exemptions, but the rules for how the state would apply those exemptions have not been written yet. Any student who refuses to take the vaccine would be forced to complete an independent study course at home.\\nUntil now, Newsom had left the decision on student vaccine mandates to local school districts, leading to a variety of different orders across some of the state’s largest districts.\\nLos Angeles and Oakland Unified have mandated all students over 12 to be vaccinated, but Oakland’s order has not set a deadline for when students must comply. LA set a deadline of 20 January. Earlier this week, the San Diego Unified school board approved a mandate that staff and students ages 16 and older be fully vaccinated by 20 December.\\nIn August, California became the first state in the US to require all teachers and staff in K-12 public and private schools to get vaccinated or undergo weekly Covid-19 testing. Newsom also issued a school mask mandate earlier in the summer for indoor classes that applies to all teachers and students.\\nThe Associated Press contributed reporting',\n",
       "  'Severely immunocompromised Australians will be able to get Covid-19 vaccine boosters from Monday, after Australia’s vaccine regulatory body approved the jab for the vulnerable section of the community.\\nIn advice released on Friday, the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (Atagi) recommended the third vaccine dose for all people aged above 12 who either have conditions that severely weaken their immune defences, as well as patients receiving cancer treatment and other therapies.\\nThe government expects about 500,000 Australians to be eligible for the initial rollout of booster shots.\\nSydney man with leukaemia denied Covid vaccine booster shot his specialist recommended\\nRead more\\nHowever, not all of the older Australians who were first to receive vaccines in early 2021 will be eligible for the early booster shots, and it’s less clear how and when boosters will be administered for the rest of the population.\\nHere is everything we know about Covid-19 vaccine booster shots.\\nWho is eligible?\\nWhen announcing the booster program on Friday, chief medical officer Paul Kelly said the severely immunocompromised group would include people who were already seen in phase one of the vaccine rollout to be priority groups.\\n“So, people with active blood malignancy, blood cancer, people with other types of malignancy as well, people that have had organ transplants, people that have had stem cell transplants, people on immunosuppressive therapy,” Kelly said.\\n“There are people … who have had transplants that have medications to dampen their immune system. But there are others on certain types of arthritis medication and steroids, for example. Those that are born with immunodeficiency, there is a group of those as well as people that are living with HIV who are not controlled under therapy.\\n“The recommended interval for the third dose is two to six months after their second dose of vaccine,” Kelly said.\\nIf I’m eligible, when and where do I get it? Is there a recommended interval between the second and third dose?\\nYou can book your third vaccine from Monday if you’re eligible, and receive it from any of the settings already participating in the rollout.\\nThe recommended interval for the third dose is two to six months after their second dose of vaccine.\\nDo I have to get the same type of vaccine as my first two doses?\\nIt depends. The Atagi advice is that third doses are of an mRNA vaccine – which are currently the Pfizer or Moderna options.\\nIf your first two doses were of an mRNA vaccine, Atagi recommends sticking with the same vaccine type for your third. For example, if your first two doses were Pfizer, you should get Pfizer for your third dose.\\nKelly also said that, in the above example, if Pfizer is not available, Moderna can be substituted, and vice versa.\\nIf your first two doses were AstraZeneca – which is not an mRNA vaccine – the advice is for your third dose to be an mRNA vaccine.\\nSydney man with leukaemia denied Covid vaccine booster shot his specialist recommended\\nRead more\\nHowever, Kelly said there may be certain circumstances where you need an AstraZeneca vaccine as your third dose, giving the example of someone who had side effects after receiving a second mRNA vaccine.\\nWho will be next in line? And when?\\nHealth minister Greg Hunt said the government is expecting advice from Atagi about the general population’s stage of the booster program “before the end of October”.\\nThe government will consider advice for health workers, as well as people with less severely compromised immune systems.\\nThere are likely to be further stages of eligibility which correspond to eligibility in the initial rollout, as opposed to the entire population becoming available at once. Hunt said “how we roll out the boosters will follow time”.\\n“It’s a time based program, so those that had their earliest vaccinations will be those that have access.”\\nDoes this put everyone else without the booster at risk?\\nNot necessarily.\\nThe urgency behind booster shots for severely immunocompromised people is ensuring all of the vaccinated population has antibodies in their system.\\nRobert Booy, a University of Sydney professor of vaccinology told Guardian Australia that vaccine data had suggested “at least half of severely immunocompromised people may not have had an immune response to either of their first two doses of vaccine”.\\n“The question is, does it make antibodies and t-cells in your system? The combination of those protect you, because they will provoke your immune system to respond.\\n“The third dose increases the chance of an effective response in severely immunocompromised people,” Booy said.\\nIt is for this reason that Booy believes most Australians won’t need third doses until at least March next year, before the winter season.\\nEven older Australians who were vaccinated in the first months of the rollout don’t necessarily require a third dose immediately to be protected, Booy said, because an older immune system alone does not pose the same issues.\\n“If they’re old, provided they’re a robust person who is still walking about in the community, that’s fine. But if they’ve got chronic diseases, then that becomes a problem.\\n“We haven’t got winter coming for another six months in Australia, so we can wait and look at the evidence coming out of the United States, Canada, Europe and Israel to know more about the effectiveness and safety of booster shots. It’s an advantage for us,” Booy said.\\nHow are other countries using boosters?\\nWhile Covid vaccine booster rollouts are taking shape in the United Kingdom and the United States, Israel’s vaccine program is the most advanced.\\nIsrael began administering third doses for its general population months ago, and the first data evaluating the impact of its booster program has found that two weeks after more than 1.1 million over-60s had received their third dose, they were 11.3 times less likely to become infected with the Delta variant that currently predominates in Israel and across the world.\\nAs a result, Israel’s government has moved to incorporate booster doses into its vaccine freedom “green pass” system. Green passes are only valid for six months after their second, or third booster shot, or after recovering from Covid.\\nDoes this mean years of booster shots?\\nIt’s unclear, according to Booy, who says there hasn’t been sufficient time for enough real world data.\\nOn Friday, Paul Kelly said: “At the moment, it appears the third dose will be enough, but we’ll just need to see”.\\nThe emergence of new Covid-19 variants could influence the need for booster shots into the future.\\nBooy said governments must work to vaccinate those without an immune response to Covid so far, including their own severely immunocompromised residents as well as the populations of developing nations without significant vaccine uptake.\\n“It’s people without the benefit of the vaccine where mutations can occur, because it keeps replicating, … and imperfect copies are made more often in immunocompromised people.\\n“So it’s our local half million of severely immunocompromised people, but also the two billion people in the world who haven’t been vaccinated, before we start giving third doses to people with mildly compromised immune systems in Australia,” he said.',\n",
       "  'Vaccination reduces the risk of dying or being hospitalised with Covid-19 by 90%, a French study of 22.6 million people over the age of 50 has found.\\nThe research published on Monday also found that vaccines appear to protect against the worst effects of the most prevalent virus strain, the Delta variant.\\n“This means that those who are vaccinated are nine times less at risk of being hospitalised or dying from Covid-19 than those who have not been vaccinated,” the epidemiologist Mahmoud Zureik, who oversaw the research, told Agence France-Presse.\\nThe study – the largest of its kind so far – was carried out by Epi-Phare a scientific group set up by France’s health system, its national health insurance fund, l’Assurance Maladie (CNAM), and the country’s ANSM medicines agency.\\nOne in six most critically ill NHS Covid patients are unvaccinated pregnant women\\nRead more\\nResearchers compared 11.3 million vaccinated over-50s with the same number of unvaccinated from the same age group between 27 December 2020, when vaccinations began in France, and 20 July this year.\\nThey found “a reduction in the risk of hospitalisation superior to 90%” from the 14th day after the second dose and a similar reduction in the number of deaths from Covid-19. Similar findings have previously been published in Israel, the UK and the US.\\nThe vaccines’ effectiveness in combatting the most serious symptoms of Covid did not diminish during the five-month period of the study, they said. The results were the same no matter whether the patient was given the Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna or Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine.\\nThe Janssen one-dose shot, authorised later in France, was not included as the researchers felt there had not been enough patients or time to properly study its effectiveness.\\nResearchers only had a month between the emergence of the Delta variant in France and the end of the study, but results showed the vaccines reduced the risk of serious symptoms and death by 84% among the over-75s and 92% for the 50-74 age group.\\n“This is a very short period to evaluate the real impact of the vaccination on this variant,” Zureik said, adding that research was continuing into the effect of vaccines on the Delta variant.\\nTo ensure the closest possible comparison, researchers paired vaccinated and unvaccinated people of the same age and sex living in the same region. The study looked only at the most serious symptoms of infection and did not examine if the vaccines stopped people becoming infected or transmitting the virus.\\nZureik said avoiding the most serious infections was “the main public health objective”. “An epidemic without serious infections is no longer an epidemic,” he added.\\nThe report concludes: “All the vaccines [studied] against Covid-19 are highly effective and have a major effect on the reductions of serious forms of Covid-19 among people aged 50 years and older living at the current time in France. The continuing research by Epi-Phare will allow us to measure the evolution of this effectiveness over a longer period and better establish the effects on the Delta variant.”',\n",
       "  'German immunologists have warned that fundamental misunderstandings about the way vaccines work persist among the population, after the Bayern Munich and Germany footballer Joshua Kimmich confirmed over the weekend that he had declined to receive a Covid jab due to concerns over long-term side-effects.\\n“I have concerns about the lack of long-term studies,” the 26-year-old told Sky Sport. “I am of course aware of my responsibility. I follow all hygiene measures and get tested every two to three days. Everyone should make the decision for themselves.”\\nThe midfielder, who captained his country in Germany’s 2-1 victory over Romania earlier this month, denied he was an anti-vaxxer and said he had not ruled out eventually receiving a vaccine: “There is a very good chance that I will still get vaccinated.”\\nNews of his unvaccinated status came as a surprise because Kimmich, who has played for his country 64 times, had been widely lauded for his mature leadership off the field. Along with his Bayern teammate Leon Goretzka, Kimmich last March set up the philanthropic initiative WeKickCorona to support charities and medical facilities requiring immediate help as a result of the pandemic.\\n“Everyone can do their own bit to ensure that the coronavirus won’t spread any further,” reads a statement on the campaign’s website.\\nBayern Munich has urged all of its players and staff to receive a Covid vaccine, and its longtime executive board chair, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, on Sunday criticised Kimmich’s reluctance: “As a role model, but also as a sheer fact, it would be better if he was vaccinated,” the club legend said.\\nSome Bundesliga clubs only allow fans into their stadiums if they are either vaccinated or have recently recovered from the virus, while Bayern also admits supporters into the Allianz Arena if they can show proof of a negative PCR test.\\nUnvaccinated footballers are putting lives at risk.

       "  'At the vaccination hub outside Termini train station in Rome, a steady flow of people have been turning up for their first Covid vaccine dose in recent days. The mood is begrudging. “If I didn’t have to do it, I wouldn’t,” said Rosanna Barbuto, a supermarket worker. Catalin, 41, who works in a factory, said: “I’m taking it because I need to work.”\\nThey are among the vaccine-hesitant who caved in after Italy made it mandatory for all workers to present a so-called green pass to access their workplaces. The rules are the strictest in Europe and require workers to present proof of vaccination, immunity or of a negative test taken within the previous 48 hours. Some see Italy’s cautious approach as the key to its current low infection rate.\\nBarbuto, 59, said she was not against vaccinations, and took the flu jab every year. “I didn’t want to take the one for coronavirus as I wasn’t sure how safe it is. I was afraid. People were talking about the side-effects and then there were all these protests. But I need to work and so need the green pass, and I don’t want to keep spending money on tests.”\\nElia works in a shopping centre and he, too, felt obliged to have the vaccine to continue to work. Those who break the green pass rules risk being suspended without pay or fined up to €1,500 (£1,270). Employers can be fined for failing to check if staff are complying.\\n“I was cautious because my wife and I want to have a baby and so we were taking our time to decide … but when the green pass came in for the workplace, we felt we had to do it,” said Elia. “We are not against vaccinations but don’t agree with the way the government has gone about this, telling people they can’t work if they don’t have this pass. They should have been more direct and made the vaccine an obligation instead of sneaking around the issue in this way.”\\nItaly’s goal with the green pass is to boost inoculations so as to reach its target coverage of 90% of the population by the end of October and to avoid another lockdown. As of Wednesday, 81% of the population aged over 12 were fully vaccinated.\\nThe pass – also required to dine inside at restaurants, to enter museums, theatres, cinemas and stadiums, and for travel on planes and long-distance trains – was brought in over the summer in combination with the maintenance of other coronavirus measures, such as wearing face masks inside shops and when using public transport.\\nThe seven-day average of new cases in Italy was 2,686 on Wednesday, down from 6,200 on 20 August and 14,003 on 20 April, a week before Italy began the gradual easing of lockdown restrictions and as the vaccination campaign was ramped up. Deaths have fallen from an average 440 in mid-April to 36 on Wednesday. However, at 131,688, the country has the second-highest death toll in Europe after the UK.\\nA study published on Wednesday found that the average age of vaccinated people who had died was 85 and who, on average, had five underlying illnesses.\\nAlthough the green pass has triggered sometimes violent protests, the majority of Italians are taking it in their stride, with 65% supporting the measure in a survey last week.\\nItaly imposes ‘green pass’ restrictions on unvaccinated people\\nRead more\\n“We’re in a privileged place, the situation is finally being well managed by the government,” said Gianfranco Cappelluzzo, who was at the Termini vaccine hub waiting for his mother while she received a booster jab. “I support the green pass and find it foolish to be against it as we’re seeing evidence that it’s the right thing to do. Fortunately, resistance to this logic is marginal.”\\nA staff member at the hub said they had seen a gradual rise in Covid-19 vaccine first-timers since September. Nationally, the workplace rule triggered an instant increase in the number of bookings for first doses when it took effect last Friday. However, that figure appears to have tailed off over the last few days, with a higher number of bookings being made for booster shots.\\n“I’ll have my third dose when the time comes around,” said Cappelluzzo. “We can’t give up.”\\nThe government has also dismissed the idea of making Covid-19 tests free, as a further way to sway people towards having the vaccine instead.\\nGiuseppe Longho, the owner of a chemist in Rome’s Esquilino district, has been selling coronavirus tests costing €22 each for about a year. The queue for the tests has grown longer since Friday.\\n“But we’ve been trying to convince customers to have the vaccine, especially those who are using the system to continue to work,” he said. “We don’t always succeed as many are angry and there is no way to negotiate. But some are realising that having to get tested every couple of days is tiresome and costly, and so they are starting to come to terms with having the vaccine.”',\n",
       "  'S\\noon, the ten-billionth Covid vaccine will roll off the production lines. By January, according to a recent report from the data research agency Airfinity, a tipping point will be reached when there will be enough vaccine doses for every adult on every continent. By June the number of doses will reach 27bn, enough to fully immunise the world’s population twice over.\\nBut despite this manufacturing triumph, we are losing badly in the arms race to actually inject every adult in every country. Next summer, on current trends, more than half the world will remain unvaccinated. We simply aren’t getting doses out to the people who need them.\\nWest will kill thousands if it keeps on hoarding vaccines, says Gordon Brown\\nRead more\\nUntil recently this was due to an understandable shortage of vaccines. But now there is a clear and inexplicable failure to distribute them equitably. Poor countries, which have injected just 2% of their adults, are being denied vaccines, while rich countries that have already fully immunised more than 60% of their citizens continue to monopolise access to doses. Thousands will die this month and for the foreseeable future, not because there are too few vaccines being produced but because they are being hoarded in the places that need them least.\\nThe promise made by Boris Johnson, on behalf of the G7 club of advanced economies, that the whole world would be vaccinated during 2021 and 2022 currently has no chance of being honoured. More than 100 countries will now not meet the September deadline to inoculate even the first 10% of their population, and as things stand they have little chance of meeting the further December deadline to vaccinate 30%.\\nThe World Health Organizaton’s Covax programme is the global bulk purchasing agency set up last year to ensure equitable vaccine distribution. But even though the G7 nations promised Covax in June that they would share 870m doses with the poorest countries, just 100m have been released to them, and overall only 4% of all vaccines produced worldwide have been channelled through Covax.\\nOur collective failure to turn the scientific success of the vaccines themselves into actual protection for all, and to avoid dividing the world into vaccine haves and have-nots, is a moral catastrophe. If the world were a state, we might well call it a failed one.\\nAnd we are in a race against time to turn things around. While countries with high vaccine coverage have broken the link between Covid cases and deaths, countries that cannot access vaccines see high case rates driving record hospitalisations and deaths. Unsurprisingly, African nations have registered their anger, with pleas this week from African leaders, the Mandela-inspired Elders group and African NGOs for vaccine equity. Concluding that they can no longer rely on the west’s promises, they set up their own bulk-purchasing agency, and are now intent on building their own vaccine manufacturing capability.\\nBut there is a way forward. An emergency G7 vaccines summit chaired by President Biden should be convened on the margins of the UN general assembly to agree a comprehensive plan to transfer the west’s unused supplies and its over-subscribed vaccine delivery contracts to Covax.\\nWe have more than enough vaccines to do this. Vaccine production is already at 1.5bn doses monthly, and will surpass 2bn per month by the end of the year. By then, we will have amassed more than 1bn unused vaccines. By mid-2022, that figure could pass 2bn.\\nUntil recently, western leaders could defend holding supplies in reserve because they feared interruptions to the manufacturing supply chain. Now there is sufficient capacity to guarantee a rising flow of vaccines for the months ahead. So many doses are being produced that the bigger risk now is that millions may go to waste.\\nWe could begin immediately. By the end of September western nations could release 500m vaccine doses, and another 200m each month thereafter. Under this plan, by mid-2022 every low-income country would have enough doses on hand to immunise 60% of its population, catching them up to rich nations’ current vaccination levels in less than a year.\\nVaccine inequality: how rich countries cut Covid deaths as poorer fall behind\\nRead more\\nVaccine-rich nations don’t have to choose between boosters and donations either. By next year, North America and Europe could vaccinate their populations, including offering boosters and providing for all over-12s, donate to meet the needs of poor countries, and still have doses left over to cover most eventualities. And if China – the world’s biggest manufacturer – were persuaded to contribute to this effort, we could advance that target date by months.\\nThe financial cost is small in comparison with the benefits in resumed employment, commerce and trade. Just $4bn (£3bn) is needed by Covax to cover its projected 2022 vaccine purchases. Comprehensive coverage – including therapeutics such as medical oxygen to save lives, and diagnostic equipment – would cost about $30bn a year. This is just 1.5% of the cost of Biden’s projected $1.9tn Covid stimulus, and, when shared between the advanced economies, eminently affordable.\\nDenying the world vaccines is self-defeating and will come back to haunt us. As the disease spreads among unvaccinated people, variants could emerge that threaten even our current vaccine coverage. Not only do the health and lives of countless millions hang in the balance, so does the sustainability of our worldwide economic recovery – and the possibility of lasting and inclusive prosperity.\\nEngland’s public health agency estimates that vaccination has saved 100,000 lives in England already. We have to ask ourselves whether Africa and the rest of the world will ever again trust us if people there continue to lose their lives from lack of vaccination. As Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, head of the WHO, has said, vaccine equity has become the challenge of our times. It is also a test of whether the world can summon up the will to work together.

Both the teenagers and the parents need to be involved in that choice.”\\nBoris Johnson is also heading for a confrontation with his own MPs after the leader of backbench Tories said vaccinations for 12- to 15 year-olds would “plainly be wrong” given lack of clear consensus among experts for pressing ahead.\\nSir Graham Brady told the Observer there would also be widespread opposition from “across the House of Commons” if ministers tried to approve Covid jabs for school-age children before there was definite medical and scientific evidence in favour.\\nBrady, who chairs the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers, said: “The JCVI has given extensive consideration to the pros and cons of vaccinating children and has concluded that the case has not been made. In my view, it would plainly be wrong to administer vaccines to children when it is not clearly to the benefit of that child’s own health.”\\nAs MPs prepare to return to Westminster this week, Brady said he believed the 70-strong Covid Recovery Group of Conservative MPs, who have opposed many of the government’s stricter lockdown measures, would be strongly against the move.

It’s quite understandable that the JCVI is taking the time to make sure.\\n“The main issue is getting the vaccine into the arms of as many people as possible, as safely as possible, because broader coverage means greater protection.

Even countries with high levels of vaccine coverage, such as Britain, could still face “an alarming future”, she added.\\n“The virus has already adapted to increase transmission between humans, with the Alpha variant and then the Delta variant becoming dominant in many countries.\\n“As the world grapples with the spread of the Delta variant, it is more crucial than ever that we do not forget the lives that could be saved by administering first and second doses to the most vulnerable populations worldwide and the opportunity that the global distribution of vaccine provides to protect all of us by reducing the selection of further Sars-CoV-2 variants.”\\nShe added: “In the longer run, strategies for managing the risk of an ever-evolving Sars-CoV-2, including through the use of definitive medical countermeasures such as vaccination, will have to be adapted to the needs and experience of each country. For now, however, with the disease still running rampant, the priority must be to vaccinate as many people as possible and as quickly as possible.”\\nGreater efforts are now urgently required to make vaccines available “for the whole world”, the Oxford University professor of vaccinology said in a letter co-written with Dr Richard Hatchett, the chief executive of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.\\nTheir letter, published in Science Translational Medicine, said that by early September this year, 41.5% of the world’s population had received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, yet only 1.9% of people in low-income countries had.\\nGilbert and Hatchett warned that offering booster jabs and vaccinating children – as is happening in the UK and other wealthy countries – would place “additional pressure on global vaccine supplies”.\\nThey wrote: “In many high-income countries, more than 50% of the population have received two doses of vaccine. In high-income countries, the next questions are whether, or when, booster doses should be administered and whether to extend vaccination to children in the pursuit of herd immunity.\\n“Such extensions of the use of Covid-19 vaccines by high income countries will place additional pressure on global vaccine supplies and potentially further increase disparities between high-income countries and the rest of the world in terms of vaccine access.”\\nEnsuring underdeveloped countries can deliver Covid-19 vaccines has become one of “the most urgent challenges in the next phase of the Covid-19 pandemic”, they said.\\n“The proliferation of authorised Covid-19 vaccines and projected rapid growth in their aggregate supply has the potential to create an embarrassment of riches,” they added.\\nWhile supply to poorer countries is slowly picking up, the new challenge is ensuring they are able to distribute the jabs to millions safely and effectively once they arrive, they said.',\n",

However, vaccination hubs and GPs in Australia do not yet allow this, aside from in exceptional circumstances.\\nThe head of the Australian Medical Association (AMA) Dr Omar Khorshid said “there’s definitely people vaccinated with AstraZeneca interested in getting Pfizer as a second dose, but that really doesn’t make any sense”.\\n“The majority of the small risk of TTS is associated with the first dose, and in addition vaccination with AstraZeneca may also provide better longer term protection than Pfizer,” he said.\\n“For those who have had their first dose of AstraZeneca it’s a no-brainer to have the second.

In terms of making mixed schedules available routinely, we note that while supplies of one vaccine are still constrained it probably isn’t possible to offer a choice to consumers.”\\nHe said the evidence available so far did suggest receiving different vaccines generates a good immune response, is effective, and seems to be safe. But much more work was needed to understand the best timeframe between dosing when mixing vaccines, and which vaccines mixes would be considered valid in other countries. Some countries are also yet to recognise vaccination passports from those who have received a mixed-dose.\\n“There is ongoing work in defining what is a ‘valid’ vaccine – it’s a complex area involving Atagi, the TGA [Therapeutic Goods Administration] and government, noting proving vaccination status is only currently required for a few workforces and we don’t yet need vaccine passports,” Cheng said.',\n",

But I would expect to hear from them in the next few days.”\\nHe said consent would be sought from parents of 12- to 15-year-olds as it has been “for decades”, but if children and their parents cannot agree, then the child’s view would take precedence as long as they are competent enough to decide.\\nHe said: “If there is a difference of opinion between the child and the parent then we have specialists that work in this area, the schools vaccination service. They would usually literally sit down with the parent and the child, and try to reach some kind of consensus.\\n“If ultimately that doesn’t work, as along as we believe that the child is competent enough to make this decision then the child will prevail.”\\nJavid also said he was “very confident” that the UK would have a booster programme so that older adults could receive a third jab.\\nHe told Sky News: “In terms of who actually gets it and when, we’re waiting for final advice which could come across, certainly, in the next few days from the JCVI.”\\nHe said the advice was expected to include information on whether people should get different vaccines from the ones they have already had, adding: “I’m confident that we can start the booster programme this month.”\\nScientists on the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) subgroup on modelling said decisions on whether to go ahead with booster vaccines and vaccines for 12- to 15-year-olds were unlikely to make a big difference to the trajectory of cases and hospitalisations over the autumn.\\nBehavioural changes, such as more mixing indoors and the severity of this year’s flu season are expected to have a bigger impact on cases and the overall burden on the NHS, according to experts, who also said they did not expect to see a steep rise in severe Covid cases over the coming weeks.\\nChris Jewell, an epidemiologist at Lancaster University, said: “Based on the current situation, most people are in agreement that we’re not likely to see a massive rise in hospitalisations over the autumn. “Things seem to be quite stable.”\\nPaul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, said that while he did not expect a surge in Covid cases, flu remained a major concern. “We’re due a bad flu year because we had very little flu last year and less the year before.

       "  'In October 2020, more than a month before the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines would receive emergency-use authorization from the FDA, the Women’s National Basketball Players Association got to work.\\nThe WNBPA understood that misinformation in regards to the virus and vaccine had been ramping up, and it seemed to be getting harder and harder to seek reliable guidance. They also likely considered that professional athletes represented a relatively easy target for misinformation and conspiracy theories as highly impressionable young people with a lot of free time on their hands – time often spent on their phones scrolling social media – and relatively little contact with the outside world. So they came together with league commissioner Cathy Engelbert and set out a plan to educate WNBA players about the Covid-19 vaccine so that they could make educated choices when the time came.\\nThe WNBA’s players’ union put together an outreach program separate from the league itself, understanding that players would be more trusting of other players than they would be the league front office or even those in charge of their teams. The WNBPA canvassed the league for their questions about the vaccine and brought in experts to answer those questions over Zoom without judgment. And they did all of this before shots were actually readily available.\\n“It’s much easier to encourage vaccination if people start from a point of uncertainty rather than a place where they have already made up their minds against it,” says Harvard health policy professor Robert Blendon.\\nSign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors’ picks.\\nAdds Atlanta Dream forward Elizabeth Williams, who originally brought the idea to the WNBPA: “I think [the player-led approach] was what made players comfortable, to be honest. If the league were to mandate it and we didn’t feel like we knew enough about it, I don’t think people would have gotten vaccinated. But because as player leadership, we were saying, ‘Hey, here’s an opportunity to ask all these questions and not feel bad about it’ – I think that was kind of what made people feel more comfortable, not feeling that extra level of pressure.\\nIt worked. Ninety-nine percent of the WNBA’s players are currently vaccinated, the most of any professional sports league in North America.\\nFast forward almost exactly one year later to the NBA’s media day on Monday marking the start of the 2021-22 season, when 90% of the league was fully vaccinated – it has since climbed to 95% who have gotten at least their first shot – a far higher percentage than the rest of the United States but along the same lines of their economic peers and lower than the WNBA and even the NFL. As usual, the vocal minority took center stage.\\nMuch of the focus was on Andrew Wiggins and Kyrie Irving – stars both and, in Irving’s case, vice president on the executive committee of the players’ union – who play in markets that require them to be vaccinated in order to play or practice at home this season and who stand to lose tens of millions of dollars if they don’t. But the NBA’s vaccine problem extends beyond a couple of high-profile holdouts: the league and the players’ union were not prepared for just how important and divisive a political issue vaccines have become over the past year, and they failed in their responsibility to get out ahead of it. Instead of being leaders on the vaccine issue like the WNBA was – and like the NBA was when it came to the Black Lives Matter protests last year – the NBA waited too long to figure out just how polarized the league was on the topic.\\nHealth and hygiene protocols are displayed on the Staples Center during an NBA game between the LA Clippers and the Lakers earlier this year.

That’s it.”\\n“People with vaccines, why are they still getting Covid?... Like, it’s funny that, ‘Oh, it reduces your chances of going to the hospital.’ It doesn’t eliminate anybody from getting COVID, right? Some people have bad reactions to the vaccine. Nobody likes to talk about that. What happens if one of our players gets the vaccine and can’t play after that? Or they have complications after that? Because there are cases like that.”\\nJonathan Isaac, a religious man who plays for the Orlando Magic, said: “At the end of the day, it’s people [developing vaccines], and you can’t always put your trust completely in people.”\\nAnd Denver Nuggets wing Michael Porter J said: “For me, I had Covid twice, I saw how my body reacted, and although the chances are slim, with the vaccine, there’s a chance you could have a bad reaction to it. For me, I don’t feel comfortable.\\n“If you want to get it because you feel more protected and you feel safer, and it’s protecting people around you, get it. That’s good for you. But if you feel like, ‘Oh, for me, I don’t feel safe getting it, then don’t get it.’”\\nForget that there are no publicly known cases of professional basketball players missing time because of side effects related to the vaccine, and severe side effects are rare for anyone. And remember that some athletes have spoken about lingering respiratory and muscle issues after contracting Covid-19, with Boston Celtics star Jayson Tatum suffering lingering impairment for months after contracting the virus last season, requiring the use of an inhaler before games to help his breathing long after he recovered. Also, forget that these vaccine holdouts are ignoring a crucial reason to get the vaccine, which is to protect others.\\nQuick Guide\\nHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?\\nShow\\nWhat’s more important is that the NBA waited just long enough for some of its star players to irresponsibly contribute to the very reason that the NBA and American society are in this predicament in the first place: the misinformation crisis. And that is the bigger issue here: not the fact that Wiggins and Irving might be willing to sit out 41 home games instead of getting the vaccine, but the fact that the NBA let it get to a point where influential NBA players are broadcasting vaccine skepticism and misinformation to a highly vulnerable American public.\\nIt was recently reported that a Moderna microchip misinformation campaign has spread across multiple NBA locker rooms and group chats, though it is unclear just how prevalent it is considering that 95% of the league is now vaccinated, up from 85% just a few weeks ago. But what is clear is that some NBA players used media day to spread misinformation and, with support from Republicans like Ted Cruz and ESPN turned Fox News pundit Will Cain, this is problematic, because even if their views don’t spread throughout NBA locker rooms, they will influence society; that is simply the territory that comes with being professional athletes, especially ones in the most politically relevant sports league in the United States.\\nNow people are calling on LA Lakers star LeBron James to call out anti-vaxxers, as he wields the biggest influence of any voice in the league. They are calling out Wiggins and Irving for refusing to acknowledge that pandemics are inherently public, and that what they call “individual decisions” matter to other people when it comes to the vaccine. But these are inherently reactionary solutions that fail to get to the heart of the issue, which is education and the mitigation of misinformation.\\nLeBron James was ‘very skeptical’ about Covid vaccine before changing mind\\nRead more\\n“They are failing to live up to the responsibilities that come with celebrity. Athletes are under no obligation to be spokespersons for the government, but this is a matter of public health,” NBA legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar said about the vaccine holdouts. He is especially disappointed in athletes of color, saying: “By not encouraging their people to get the vaccine, they’re contributing to these deaths.”\\nYes, star players like LeBron should encourage the brotherhood that is the NBA to get vaccinated in order to protect themselves and others. But it will take a much more concerted effort on behalf of the league and its players association to mitigate the damage that has already been done and to properly educate its vaccine holdouts before it is too late. The fact that we have seen nothing similar to the WNBA’s player-led vaccine outreach program in the NBA is disappointing, but there is still a huge opportunity for the NBA players’ union to create an educational vaccine program for the players and public alike.\\n\\n“If Black Lives Matter is what we’re about, then in the public health space, this is really big for Black and brown communities,” executive director of the WNBA players union, Terri Jackson, says of the message sent by the WNBPA, citing the fact that Black Americans have been disproportionately hospitalized with and died from Covid-19. They also continue to get vaccinated at a slower rate than any other race or ethnicity measured by the CDC. “We better be informed, and we better be ready to show up.”\\nThe NBA was not informed, and they were not ready to show up. Instead of blaming others for the vaccine crisis on hand, they should probably take a long look in the mirror and get to work, because nobody else is going to solve this problem for them.',\n",

YouTube, which is owned by Google, has removed a total of 1m videos for spreading general Covid falsehoods since the pandemic broke out.\\nMatt Halprin, the global head of trust and safety at YouTube, said vaccine misinformation was a global problem and had spilled over from the spreading of falsehoods about Covid jabs.\\n“Vaccine misinformation appears globally, it appears in all countries and cultures,” he said.\\nHalprin added that falsehoods around the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, which has been wrongly attributed to causing autism, were an example of the misinformation YouTube will target.\\n“There is still a lot of challenges around MMR and people arguing whether that causes autism. And as we know, the science is very stable that vaccines do not cause autism,” he said.\\nHalprin said the ban would also apply, for instance, to content that claims vaccines cause cancer, infertility or contain microchips, the latter having gained prominence as a falsehood about Covid jabs.\\nIn 2019, a major study affirmed that there was no link between autism and MMR, in the wake of a pre-Covid upsurge in vaccine scepticism, fanned by social media and anti-government populism. A paper in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine, which is published by the American College of Physicians, found “no support for the hypothesis of increased risk for autism after MMR vaccination in a nationwide unselected population of Danish children”.\\nHalprin said the new guidelines will still allow personal testimonies on taking vaccines, discussion of vaccine policies and references to historical failures in vaccine programmes, as long as the content does not include broad misinformation or promote vaccine hesitancy. As well as applying to falsehoods about vaccines for specific diseases such as hepatitis, the guidelines will apply to general statements about vaccines that are deemed to be misleading.\\nOn Wednesday, a search under the terms “MMR vaccine autism” produced a page of results containing rebuttals of any link between the vaccine and autism, including a video entitled “Vaccines and autism: how the myth started”. However, the page also includes a TV interview with the actor Robert De Niro in which he states that Vaxxed, a documentary directed by Andrew Wakefield – one of the key figures in promoting discredited links between MMR and autism – is a film that “people should see”.

The vaccines, however, do hugely reduce the risk of contracting and spreading the virus and getting seriously ill, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and are safe to take. The vast majority of hospitalisation and deaths due to Covid-19 are among unvaccinated people, not breakthrough infections of those who have had the jabs.\\nHowever, Higgins cautions against tarring all vaccine hesitant police officers with one brush.\\n“The assumption is that they are conspiracy theorists, that they are anti-government, and that’s not really true,” said Higgins. “You have people who have honest concerns or have figured that since they have had Covid once or twice, they are building up antibodies and those antibodies are good enough.”\\nIn Wisconsin, the Milwaukee Police Supervisors’ Organization reached an agreement earlier this week with the city that requires union members to be vaccinated or wear masks while on duty except when eating or drinking at a safe distance from others, according to the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel. If they repeatedly break the rules, officers could face termination.\\nAndrew Wagner, acting president of the Milwaukee Police Association, does not support the deal, even though he acknowledges that it’s better than a complete mandate such as the one in Seattle.\\n“We are still in good faith negotiating with the city to try to reduce those penalties for our officers,” said Wagner.\\nFor some police unions, the vaccine requirement, like requirements to wear body cameras, is a change in work conditions and therefore demands negotiations, said Wexler, who has led the research forum since 1993.\\n“Labor is saying you can’t just do that. You have to bargain first. In other words, they want something from management for their willingness to get vaccinated,” Wexler said.\\nSandra C Quinn, a professor of family science at University of Maryland School of Public Health who has studied the role of communication in vaccine acceptance, said that discussions between vaccine hesitant officers and health workers or officers who have become sick with Covid can increase the vaccination numbers.\\n“We have seen in the health care setting that people who have been vaccine refusers have been willing to change their stance,” said Quinn.\\nStill, Quinn thinks mandates are also effective.\\nStefani L’Esperance, a detective in St Petersburg, Florida, waits 15 minutes after receiving her second dose of the Covid vaccine. Photograph: Martha Asencio-Rhine/AP\\nIn Chicago, the city instituted a requirement for officers to report their vaccination status by Friday. Those who are not vaccinated must submit to semiweekly coronavirus testing. If they refuse, they will be placed on unpaid leave.\\nJohn Catanzara, president of the Fraternal Order of Police (FOP), sued over the mandate and suggested that if the city enforces its requirement and many union members refuse to comply with it, “it’s safe to say that the city of Chicago will have a police force at 50% or less for this weekend coming up”, the Associated Press reported.\\nMayor Lori Lightfoot countered that the city is “focused on making sure that we maximize the opportunity to create a very safe workplace. The data is very clear. It is unfortunate that the FOP leadership has chosen to put out a counter-narrative.”\\nRegardless of the merits of officers’ refusal to get the vaccine, Thomas, the Florida professor and a retired police officer, thinks encouraging employees or offering cash incentives – as some counties in Florida did – is more effective than punishments, which risk worsening staff shortages.\\n“You won’t have any people to respond to calls for service because they made this decision that they are going to terminate people,” Thomas said of cities like Seattle, which has already lost 300 officers over the past year, according to KOMO, a local TV station.\\nOn 6 October, 292 officers in the city had not yet provided proof of vaccination and 111 had filed exemption requests, representing more than a third of the force.\\n“Folks are on pins and needles because we don’t know what the numbers are going to look like after Monday,” said Huserik of the Seattle police.\\nBut the mandate does appear to have encouraged some officers to get the vaccine. By 14 October, 171 officers had not submitted proof of vaccination, representing a 41% decrease from a week earlier.\\n“I think mandates are going to bring people around,” said Quinn. “I have been in health care settings where people are saying, ‘I’m going to quit. I’m going to quit,’ but when push comes to shove, they get vaccinated.”',\n",

Sending children back to school without masks, extra ventilation, bubbles and isolation policies was “a total recipe for ensuring everybody gets exposed”, she added.\\n“I don’t understand why we are not getting on with it. It seems urgent. Urgent to protect these children, and to protect their families, and to protect their education,” she said. “We should have started this in the summer.”\\nJorja Halliday, a 15-year-old from Portsmouth, died from Covid last week on the day she was due to have her Covid jab. She developed myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart, days after contracting the virus. While some cases of heart inflammation have been recorded as an extremely rare side-effect of the vaccine, none have led to deaths in young people.

The NHS aims to have most children in the group vaccinated before October half-term.\\nProf John Simpson, consultant paediatric cardiologist at the Evelina London Children’s hospital and president of the British Congenital Cardiac Association, said Jorja Halliday’s death was “a sad reminder” that while Covid is rarely serious in young people, it can still be fatal.\\nThe first official figures on Covid vaccine uptake among healthy 12 to 15-year-olds in England are expected this week, the Guardian understands. Dr Nikki Kanani, deputy lead for the NHS vaccination programme, said hundreds of schools in England are already vaccinating pupils.\\nSince the start of the autumn term, infection rates have soared in secondary schools in England, with about one in 20 children in years seven to 11 now expected to test positive for Covid, according to the Office for National Statistics.\\nVaccinating teenagers against Covid is priority, says UK epidemiologist\\nRead more\\n“Any death of a child is one too many,” said Russell Viner, professor in adolescent health at UCL, who has advised Sage. “The chances of teenagers without other medical conditions getting very sick or dying from Covid is extremely small.

Many parents who contacted the Guardian in response to a call-out about the Covid vaccine programme for 12- 15-year-olds were still waiting to hear when their child might be vaccinated, their schools left often in the dark too.\\nBueno said: “The school sent a message earlier this week asking parents to stop asking the school for information on when the vaccination programme will commence as they hadn’t received any information on it yet.\\n“I would like my daughter to be vaccinated as soon as possible as the number of cases in the community are still very high. My son had Covid a few weeks ago after an outbreak in his class. So I’m in fear she will be next.”\\nAn ITU nurse in Suffolk was similarly worried. “My daughter was due to have her vaccine at school last week. Thanks to the fuel crisis, explained away as ‘unforeseen circumstances’, that didn’t happen, and the vaccinations have been cancelled until further notice.\\n“Over a third of my daughter’s classmates have now tested positive via lateral flow tests and are now isolating. I worked in ITU over the height of the second wave, and having seen the very worst of the pandemic I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemies.”\\nIn South Yorkshire there were also delays. “The school vaccination team are expected in our secondary school mid November. This is horrifying given the current rate of spread in our schools,” said one reader who responded to the call-out. “I’ve been in touch with our MP to ask why drop-in clinics are not available for 12-15s as they are in Scotland. It’s a desperate situation. No one seems to have an answer as to why England is adopting this incredibly slow roll-out.”\\nIn Leicester, a mother with two children, in separate secondary schools, said each child had had postponed vaccination dates with no explanation. “No information has been provided to parents as to why that is, nor have we been told when vaccination will take place. The lack of information is troubling.”\\nIn the east Midlands another mother said: “My 14-year-old was due to have the vaccine on 8 October at school, and I’d given my consent a couple of weeks ago via the online portal.\\n“Today, 6 October, we received notice that the vaccine won’t be given on Friday. The reason cited was, ‘the uptake of the vaccine for children has been extremely popular and the NHS trust are having to reschedule the dates in order to fit everyone in’. No future date has been given to the school.”\\nIn Wiltshire there was disappointment too. One mother. said: “My son is 12 and was supposed to get the vaccination today along with the flu vaccination. The Covid vaccination was cancelled with 24 hours’ notice although the flu vaccination went ahead. We don’t know why the vaccination was cancelled or when it will happen.\\n“We want our son to be fully vaccinated, as his cousins are in Germany, but it’s not clear if he will be before half term. If we had been given the choice I would have booked him in and he would have had a vaccination already.”',\n",

Many of us are frustrated with the nearly 80 million Americans who are still not vaccinated even though the vaccine is safe, effective and free.”\\nBiden’s speech in the state dining room of the White House, against a backdrop of Abraham Lincoln’s portrait and with watching reporters crammed tightly, was seen as a high-profile attempt to claw back momentum and offer reassurance to Americans feeling despair about whether the pandemic will ever end.\\n02:35\\nBiden: 'Patience wearing thin with unvaccinated Americans' – video\\nThe president unveiled a six-pronged strategy, relying on regulatory powers and other steps. He said the Department of Labor was developing an emergency temporary standard that will require all employers with more than 100 employees to ensure their workers are vaccinated or tested weekly.\\nThis will affect more than 80 million workers in private sector businesses. Companies that do not comply could face fines of up to nearly $14,000 per violation.\\nBiden said: “The bottom line: we’re going to protect vaccinated workers from unvaccinated co-workers. We’re going to reduce the spread of Covid-19 by increasing the share of the workforce that is vaccinated in businesses all across America.”\\nThe move provoked instant criticism from conservatives sceptical of government overreach. Kevin Stitt, the governor of Oklahoma, said: “It is not the government’s role to dictate to private businesses what to do.”\\nA New York City restaurant informs customers that they will need to show proof vaccination.

The move represents a toughening of measures that Biden announced in late July, requiring federal workers to offer proof of vaccination or submit to regular testing and physical distancing measures in the workplace.\\nHe said: “Today, in total, the vaccine requirements in my plan will affect about 100 million Americans, two-thirds of all workers.”\\nBiden says ‘we can and we will turn the tide on Covid-19’ in White House speech – as it happened\\nRead more\\nIn another nod to public desire for life to get back to normal, the president called on entertainment venues such as sports arenas and big concert halls to require that patrons be vaccinated or show a negative test for entry.\\nBiden seemed to be on course to effectively defeat the virus in early July, but has been accused of underestimating the highly contagious Delta variant and the intransigence of millions of unvaccinated Americans.\\nThe fresh wave, combined with America’s shambolic withdrawal from Afghanistan, threatens to inflict lasting political damage on Biden and derail his ambitious legislative agenda. His approval rating has dipped below 50% in opinion polls.\\nBiden gave voice to those who accuse the unvaccinated of holding the nation back and putting public safety at risk. “My message to unvaccinated Americans is this: what more is there to wait for? What more do you need to see? We’ve made vaccinations free, safe and convenient.”\\nHe added: “We’ve been patient but our patience is wearing thin and your refusal has cost all of us. So please, do the right thing.”\\nHe went on the rebuke air travellers who ignore mask rules. “TSA will double the fines on travelers that refuse to mask. If you break the rules be prepared to pay. And by the way, show some respect!”\\nThe second prong of the new plan aims to offer further protection for the more than 175 million people who are already fully vaccinated. This includes preparing to make booster shots available as soon as the Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) grant approval.\\nBiden also called for governors to require vaccinations for teachers and school staff; currently only nine states have such measures in place.\\nMask mandates have become a toxic political issue, with the Republican governors of some states, such as Florida and Texas, seeking to ban them only to face dissent from some school districts and legal challenges.

Talk about bullying in schools. If they’ll not help, these governors will not help us beat the pandemic, I will use my powers as president to get them out of the way.”\\nHe promised that the Department of Education would make additional funding available to help local school districts backfill salaries and other funding where it has been withheld by state leaders for implementing safety measures.\\nThe administration will also require vaccinations for teachers and staff at Head Start and Early Head Start programmes, teachers at the Department of Defense, and teachers and staff at Bureau of Indian Education-operated schools. These schools and programmes serve more than 1 million children a year and employ nearly 300,000 staff.\\nThe plan pushes for accelerated production of rapid Covid-19 tests, including at-home tests, seeks to protect the economic recovery by helping more than 150,000 small businesses and improves care for people with Covid-19 by giving additional help to hospitals currently overwhelmed.\\nMore than 208 million Americans have received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, and 177 million are fully vaccinated, but confirmed cases of the virus have soared in recent weeks to an average of about 140,000 per day, with about 1,000 people dying from the virus daily, according to data from the CDC.\\nMost of the spread and the vast majority of severe illness and death is occurring among those not yet fully vaccinated against the virus, predominantly in areas that voted for Donald Trump in last year’s presidential election.\\nBiden, who ignored shouted questions from reporters, added: “What makes it incredibly more frustrating is we have the tools to combat Covid-19, and a distinct minority of Americans, supported by a distinct minority of elected officials, are preventing us from turning the corner.”\",\n",

Please, please do the right thing. Please get the shot. It can save your life and the lives of those around you.”\\nTwo panels of independent experts, under the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), have carved out categories of Americans eligible to receive a third dose of the Pfizer vaccine.\\nBut both agencies approved boosters for far fewer Americans than Biden had hoped.\\nPeople who have received two shots of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines remain well protected against hospitalization and death. Booster shots may limit transmission, but it is unclear to what extent.\\nBoosters are not expected to significantly change the trajectory of the pandemic. Only getting more new people vaccinated is likely to significantly alter rates of hospitalizations and deaths.\\nIn August, Biden told Americans the general public would be eligible for booster shots of both two-shot vaccines by 20 September. In a high-profile address he said, “Just remember, as a simple rule: eight months after your second shot, get a booster shot.”\\nHowever, rules around boosters have proved far from simple. While leaders at the FDA and CDC agreed with Biden’s plan, the independent panels which help guide decision-making at each agency had not looked at the data. When they did, experts significantly winnowed down who they believed should be eligible for a third dose.\\nThe FDA approved booster doses for recipients of the Pfizer vaccine six months after their second dose, but only for those aged 65 years and older or those between 18 and 65 who had a high chance of developing severe Covid-19 or being exposed at work.\\nThe CDC said who “should” and who “may” get a booster shot. According to that guidance, people older than 65, aged 50 to 64 with underlying health conditions or between 18 and 65 and in long-term care “should” receive a booster.\\nYounger people who risk exposure at work and have underlying health conditions “may” get a booster.\\nPeople with compromised immune systems should receive a third dose of the Pfizer vaccine. The FDA and CDC recommended a third dose for this group with relatively little fanfare.\\nThe FDA and CDC are expected to separately review the evidence for a booster dose of the Moderna and Johnson & Johnson shots.\\nAs Biden received his third dose, he implied eligibility may expand in the future.\\n“Last week they laid out who is eligible for those boosters for now,” he said.\\nBiden reminded reporters he was eligible to receive a third dose because he is 78. He also said the first lady, Jill Biden, would get a booster dose. She is 70.\\n“The most important thing we need to do is get more people vaccinated,” said Biden, giving out a number so Americans can locate nearby distributors.\\n“Over 77% of adults have gotten at least one shot,” he said. “About 22% haven’t gotten any shots, and that distinct minority is causing an awful lot of damage for the rest of the county.”\\nBiden said he would travel to Chicago on Wednesday to push more employers to mandate vaccines for staff.\\nAfter a nurse administered the shot, Biden rolled down his sleeve and buttoned his cuff then walked to the dais for questions.\\n“I’m a born optimist,” he said. “I think things are going to go well, and we’re going to get it done.”',\n",

I will not sugarcoat that at all,” Dr Alexander Wielaard, its medical director, said. “We have been seeing an abnormal number of patients.”\\n‘I cried after I heard the news’\\nGuam has been seeing close to 300 cases some days in the last few weeks, reversing months of steady decline. It has recorded 14,705 cases – nine percent of Guam’s population of 160,000 – and 195 deaths.\\nCovid test results in the past two months have shown an alarming rate of breakthrough cases of people who had been vaccinated, including 554 of the 1,765 positive cases in August. Overall, breakthrough cases represent 31% of infections – the highest rate in the US, where most states have less than 1%. Breakthrough patients in Guam account for about 40% of hospital admissions.\\nThe Covid surge is perplexing for a territory with a vaccination rate close to 90%, ranking sixth in the US. To date, a total of 118,756 people – or 87.13% – of Guam’s eligible population (residents 12 years and older) are fully vaccinated.

Thank God I tested negative.”\\n‘The numbers should not be taken out of context’\\nWhile there has been some vaccine hesitancy, experts caution that the vaccines are working to protect citizens, and estimate that case numbers would be three times higher than they are had the vaccination rate not been so high and that when vaccinated people are hospitalised, their stays are much shorter and illnesses much less severe.\\n“It is clear that most people who stay longer in the hospital are unvaccinated. The length of stay for people who are vaccinated average around two days. They are minor admissions and use less amount of resources at the hospital than those who are unvaccinated,” said Dr Nathan Berg, who heads the governor’s physician advisory group.\\nAs for the reasons why there has been such a big third wave on the island, experts point to a number of factors.\\n“Best guess on our higher rate may be related to close family culture and our high co-morbidities, which might lower the immune system,” said Dr Hoa Nguyen, the former chair of the governor’s physicians advisory group.\\nHe attributes the surge to the lifting of restrictions on social gatherings such as weddings and funerals, and believes Guam may have prematurely returned to normal as the Delta variant reached the island.\\n“You have to look at the number of tests we are doing,” says Berg, who pointed to the fact Guam’s testing rate was higher than any other US state. “That is a good thing, and those numbers should not be taken out of context.”\\nHe added that the people who died despite being fully vaccinated all had multiple co-morbidities.\\nDr Peter Lombard, a member of the advisory group, attributed the high rate of breakthrough cases to waning efficacy of the vaccine six months after being administered.\\nNathaniel Berg heads the governor’s physician advisory group. Photograph: Ken San Nicolas/The Guardian\\n“I trust that the data is real. Now is it a cause for alarm? That is the question,” he said. “One thing you need to do is look at other places that have good vaccination rates and high allocation of vaccines early on.\\n“Looking at distribution of vaccines and the high volume of vaccines given to Guam, I suspect that is since we have a larger vaccinated population early on and the vaccines’ efficacy waned sooner than we see in other states.”\\nLombard also said a premature lifting of restrictions was partially responsible for the Covid surge.\\nLombard and Berg agreed that Guam had benefitted from its high vaccination rate, with Lombard saying Guam’s case numbers would have been three times worse if not for the vaccination campaign.\\nBerg said that despite the recent Covid surge, “if you look at the population’s fatality rate, we are still doing well – that is an accomplishment in itself”.',\n",
       "  'I\\nt was the news that parents had been waiting to hear for more than a year and a half: on Monday, Pfizer and BioNTech announced that their Covid-19 vaccine is safe and effective for children aged five to 11. The pediatric dose, administered at one-third the volume of the adult dose, creates a “robust” immune response that is predicted to protect child patients from severe disease and death from Covid. Crucially, the trials, in which the vaccine was administered to 2,268 children, found no cases of myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart that is a very rare but serious side-effect of some mRNA vaccines in adults. The companies are requesting emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration, (FDA) and if the FDA moves at the same pace that it did in granting emergency approval for the adult vaccine, that will mean that vaccinations of school-aged children could begin as early as Halloween – though logistical and political obstacles could still delay the shots.\\nThe announcement is a light at the end of the tunnel for parents, who have seen their children’s lives unfairly warped by the coronavirus pandemic. Schools were closed, activities were shuttered, and opportunities to visit relatives or play with other kids were suddenly fraught with risk. During the long wait for child vaccinations, the commentary on the urgency of vaccine development has rightly focused on the pandemic’s devastating effects on children – medical, educational and developmental.\\nBut the prospect of child vaccines also offers much needed relief for the adults, most of them women, who are tasked with caring for children: teachers, childcare workers and, above all, mothers.\\nThe ability to vaccinate kids, and the hope for more regular and dependable schooling and childcare that it brings, could be tremendously meaningful for women’s equality. Women were economically devastated by the pandemic, and childcare responsibilities were a big part of why. With schools and daycares closed, and female-dominated sectors like the service industry hit especially hard, women were forced out of their jobs at a disproportionate rate between February 2020 and March 2021. An estimated 1.8 million women dropped out of paid work during that time, erasing, in just one year, 30 years’ worth of women’s gains in the workforce.\\nIn December 2019, before the pandemic struck, researchers found that women held a slim majority of the nation’s salaried jobs – 50.04%. It was the first time in history that women were the majority of the workforce. But in March and April 2020, about 3.5 million mothers of school-age children left paid work. Many have returned to work since. Others have not. At the beginning of 2021, there were 1.4 million fewer working mothers than there were at the beginning of 2021.\\nOf those who did not leave their jobs, the pandemic placed huge childcare responsibilities on parents, particularly mothers, that drained energy and focus from paid work. Blue-collar workers missed shifts and scrambled to find childcare for the hours they had to spend on the job. Meanwhile, many white-collar workplaces responded by adjusting their workplace cultures – making hours more flexible, allowing breaks for childcare, and becoming accustomed to toddlers wandering in the backgrounds of Zooms. But these adjustments, welcome as they were, were not enough to alleviate the added stress placed on mothers who continued to work for pay while also supervising children round the clock. Many women who did not leave the workforce found that they still fell behind.\\nWomen’s economic losses are not just a matter of stalled individual ambitions. They have broad social implications. Women’s incomes are essential for the economic security of their households. A study by the Center for American Progress found that in 2017, before Covid, 41% of women were the sole or primary breadwinners in their families. Their retreat from the paid workforce has contributed to the economic downturn nationwide. And in individual families, a mother’s paid work often has benefits beyond the financial. It also has the ability to foster gender equity within the home. Women who earn their own money have more influence over household decisions, and have more ability to leave relationships that turn unhappy or abusive.\\nThere is some evidence, too, that children raised by working mothers benefit psychologically from their moms’ independence. A Harvard study showed that children raised by working moms are just as happy in adulthood as children raised by stay-at-home mothers, and that women whose mothers worked while they were growing up perform better in their own careers. But with the pandemic-induced childcare crisis closing schools and unvaccinated children under their mothers’ care for greater and greater swaths of the day, much of these advantages were lost.\\nMuch of this was supposed to be alleviated at the start of this school year, when many schools finally reopened for full-time, in-person classes. But with no vaccines available to children under 12, elementary and middle schools remained vulnerable to infection. Outbreaks and quarantines have been frequent. Even in those lucky districts that have been able to institute safety measures such as social distancing, improved ventilation and mandatory mask-wearing, schools have still posed some risk: after all, with children under 12 still unable to access the vaccine, schools are indoor gatherings of large numbers of unvaccinated people.\\nThe inability to administer vaccines to children has made schools, as childcare, both risky and unreliable. Parents must send their kids there, knowing the risks but also knowing that if they do not send their kids to school, they will sacrifice both their children’s educations and their own livelihoods. But because of the frequency of outbreaks, some families find that their children are sent home anyway.\\nTeachers and childcare workers, who are overwhelmingly women, find themselves in this bind, too: they risk both exposing their own kids to the virus in schools and daycares, and being exposed themselves. The risks of exposure to the virus in rooms full of unvaccinated kids has made childcare centers even more expensive and even more difficult to staff, as many workers calculate that the money they earn taking care of children does not justify the risk to their health. That, too, forces more women out of the workforce.\\nIt will take more than child vaccinations to reverse the trend that has forced women out of paid work. A long-term vision for women’s economic equality will require paid leave policies, more robust equal pay measures, universal childcare, enforcement of laws against sexual harassment and pregnancy discrimination, and many, many more unions. But the prospect of vaccinated kids is welcome news for women workers who have been saddled with a dangerous and unjust double burden of work and childcare, without sufficient support for either. Hopefully now, with kids’ shots on the way, working mothers can breathe a little easier.\\nMoira Donegan is a Guardian US columnist',\n",
       "  'The Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, has signaled that he will snub New York City vaccination rules when he travels to next week’s UN general assembly claiming not to have received a Covid jab.\\nBolsonaro is the only G20 leader who publicly claims not to have been vaccinated against a disease that has killed nearly 600,000 Brazilians, although the decision to place a 100-year secrecy order on his immunization records means many citizens doubt that claim.\\nRussia slams New York’s vaccine requirement for UN general assembly\\nRead more\\nOn Thursday night Bolsonaro reiterated his supposed decision to decline a vaccine despite New York City health authorities having said delegates must show proof of vaccination if they plan to eat indoors or enter the general assembly hall.\\n“Why would I get vaccinated?” Brazil’s far-right president declared during an online broadcast, claiming his antibody levels were so high that it was unnecessary. Bolsonaro tested positive for Covid-19 in July 2020.\\n“Once everyone has been vaccinated, I’ll decide my future,” Bolsonaro added, using his finger to wipe his nose.\\nThe Brazilian leader’s appearance at the UN meeting appears assured after the secretary general, António Guterres, admitted it would be impossible to deny access to unvaccinated heads of state. Delegates will not be required to show proof of immunization before attending the event, whose opening speech will be given by Bolsonaro on Tuesday.\\nBut Bolsonaro’s decision to brush off Mayor Bill de Blasio’s vaccine mandates has sparked domestic criticism and is unlikely to help the Brazilian leader in his reported quest to win over the world at next week’s assembly.\\n“Just guess which politician hasn’t been vaccinated and is going to expose his country and citizens to yet another international embarrassment?” tweeted Erika Kokay, a congresswoman from the leftist Workers’ party (PT).\\nWhen Brazil’s pro-Trump president made his last in-person appearance at the UN general assembly, in 2019, he offered a cantankerous 30-minute speech in which he attacked the media and the left.\\nSome reports suggest Bolsonaro plans to strike a softer tone this year as part of efforts to mend relations with Trump’s successor, Joe Biden, and appease the world ahead of November’s Cop26 climate summit. A report from CNN Brasil, whose coverage is often sympathetic to Brazil’s president, claimed Bolsonaro planned to make a “pro-Biden speech” taking in themes such as climate change, sustainable development and the fight against deforestation.\\nExperts are doubtful such a rhetorical shift will convince the international community given the damage done to the environment since Bolsonaro took office in January 2019. “I really don’t think the world will buy this so easily,” Suely Araújo, the former head of Brazil’s environmental agency, Ibama, said in a recent interview.',\n",
       "  'M\\negan, a 30-year-old from rural Nebraska, feels torn. She hasn’t been vaccinated against Covid-19, but if left to her own devices, things would be different. She worries about what would happen if she caught the virus and passed it on to her toddler daughter, whose history of health complications includes hospitalization for lung problems. Megan feels a responsibility to protect her child. But she also doesn’t want to keep secrets from her husband – who, along with his mother, is adamantly against the vaccine for political reasons. (All names in this story have been changed.)\\nAs she figures out how to protect herself and her daughter without inciting major family conflict, Megan admits that her husband’s reliance on conspiracy theories he learns from like-minded friends or social media posts has made it difficult to trust him. Especially now.\\n“Had we been dating during the pandemic, this may have been a dealbreaker,” she says.\\nThough the percentage of Americans who have received at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine is slowly climbing amid the rise of the Delta variant, some have firmly made up their minds not to get the shot. Reasons for refusing the vaccine may vary, but one common byproduct has become clear: seriously strained relationships with loved ones on the other side of the heated moral and ideological debate.\\n‘A daily source of anxiety’\\nBrianna, a 31-year-old freelancer and mother of four in St Paul, Minnesota, grew up in a home that emphasized showing kindness and respect to others. As she sees it, her politically conservative parents’ decision to opt out of the Covid-19 vaccine flies in the face of the values they raised her to hold dear.\\n“My parents gave me all my vaccines as a kid, but they don’t understand where I’m coming from as a parent today,” she says. “It feels like there’s a disintegration of trust happening that won’t be easily repaired.”\\nBefore the pandemic, Brianna and her husband relied on her parents for childcare during the workweek. But since March 2020, Brianna has found herself turning down contracts in order to care for her kids while her husband works outside the home. Now, with their children returning to school and the Delta variant gaining steam across the country, she and her husband are debating whether their family should pause in-person contact with her parents altogether.\\n“It’s been hurtful for me to be honest with them and tell them I don’t want them to get sick,” says Brianna. “For them to say, ‘If it’s our time, it’s our time’ feels dismissive of me, as someone who doesn’t want to lose her parents or have her parents experience severe illness.”\\nMeredith, a 35-year-old in southern Oregon, says her unvaccinated parents – who happen to live next door – are a “daily source of anxiety”.\\nMeredith also received all of her shots growing up. But in recent years, she has watched her mother’s pursuit of holistic health remedies morph into a sweeping distrust of mainstream healthcare. Meredith, meanwhile, pursued a career in public health.\\n“My parents truly believe they’re making the best decision for their health by not getting vaccinated,” Meredith says. “The problem is, we have totally different views about what ‘health’ means during a global pandemic.”\\nBecause Covid-19 transmission rates are low in their area, so far, Meredith has allowed her kids to see their grandparents. Still, she says it feels like the adults are constantly tiptoeing around discussions of health and politics to avoid conflict. Though she and her husband plan on vaccinating their children as soon as they’re able to, she doesn’t look forward to telling her parents.\\n‘We just don’t talk’\\nFor Renae, a 31-year-old stay-at-home parent from Charleston, South Carolina, the conflict has unfolded mostly in her Instagram inbox. That’s where she says her sister has sent countless memes promoting unfounded conspiracy theories about the pandemic and Covid-19 vaccines.\\n“She’s not full-on ‘microchip in the vaccine’, but she’s definitely afraid of the vaccine and thinks more people have died from it than from Covid,” Renae says.\\nRenae, who is vaccinated, has an autoimmune disease that makes her more vulnerable to severe illness from the coronavirus. Renae says that her sister is not only unsympathetic, but she blames Renae’s childhood vaccines – the same ones she got as a child – for her illness. Renae has given up on arguing with her sister, but did recently ask that her sister stop pushing her views on her via social media.\\n“She thinks I’ve abandoned the relationship and I’m living in fear because I’ve set boundaries,” Renae says. The two sisters currently aren’t talking, and Renae is not sure when they will speak again.\\nRachel, 34, a sales professional in Nashville, is in a similar ideological stalemate with her brother. “He believes he has information about what’s happening in our world, as if he’s enlightened and everyone else just goes along without questioning the ‘powers that be’,” she says.\\nRachel and her brother have been close for most of their adult lives. He was sympathetic when she contracted Covid this past January, which warp her senses of taste and smell to this day. Despite all this, Rachel knew that her decision to trust her doctors and get the vaccine would put space between her and her sibling – at least for a while.\\n“He feels so strongly about his stance and is so vocal that it feels difficult to avoid it in a relationship,” Rachel says. “So the result is, we just don’t talk.”\\nDrawing the line\\nFor some, vaccine conflict avoidance is simply not an option. Richard, a 74-year-old retired entrepreneur from Milwaukee, says he has been going on a yearly out-of-state trip with his wife and the same four other couples “for many years”. But when one member of the group recently admitted that he wasn’t vaccinated, the others had to reassess their plans. They ultimately agreed that, because of the ages and health risks of everyone involved, vaccination was non-negotiable for joining in this year’s vacation.\\n“In the end, he decided to drop out of the trip,” says Richard.\\nThough the confrontation was cordial enough, Richard says the ordeal put a wrench in the group’s tradition and mutual trust. In an ideal world, he would want to talk things out with his friend, in person. But realistically, he’s not sure whether he or his wife will ever feel comfortable meeting with an unvaccinated person during the pandemic.\\nThe vaccine-avoidant are feeling the strain, too. Paulina, 31, has been staying with her parents in New York City since coming down with a severe case of Covid-19 in April. Since then, she’s made the decision to wait at least six months post-recovery to get vaccinated. This timeline is based on anecdotal warnings and not the advice of a health professional, but Paulina reasons that her body is still recovering from the illness. She says that, as a result, her relationship with her father has taken a major hit.\\n“He believes I’m crazy and stupid, and we’ve had a ton of fights over the matter,” she says.\\nPaulina’s vaccine stance has also affected her relationship with her extended family. Certain relatives won’t come to gatherings where she’s present, and she’s not able to go to their houses either. “It hasn’t been a good feeling,” she says.\\nAs the pandemic continues, many will find themselves doubling down on where they stand, despite potential friction. For Megan, protecting her daughter has become more important than avoiding conflict at home – so she’s working up the courage to make a vaccine appointment.\\n“I plan to emphasize to my husband that just as he values being able to make choices for his own body, so do I,” she says. “I’m just going to tell him I’m going to get the vaccine, and then give him a kiss on the forehead on the way out.”',\n",

       "  'I\\nn a shocking symbol of the west’s failure to honour its promise of equitable vaccine distribution, millions of Covid vaccines manufactured in Africa that should have saved the lives of Africans have been shipped to Europe in recent weeks. Indeed I have learned from African leaders that, this month and next, about 10m single-shot Johnson & Johnson (J&J) vaccines filled and finished at the Aspen factory in South Africa will be exported to Europe, at the very time that Africa is grappling with its deadliest wave of Covid-19 infections yet.\\nCompared with the swift development of the pathbreaking Covid vaccines, getting shots into all the world’s arms should be straightforward. But vaccine nationalism – and Europe’s neocolonial approach to global health – is dividing the world into rich and protected people, who live, and those who are poor, unprotected and at risk of dying.\\nOf the 4.7bn vaccines that have been distributed globally, more than 80% have gone to the richest G20 countries. The gap between rich and poor is now so wide that, while high-income countries have administered almost 100 doses for every 100 citizens, low-income countries have administered only 1.5 doses per 100.\\nTo date, 496m vaccines have been administered across the European Union, which has a population of roughly 440 million people. Only 77.3m doses have been administered across Africa’s population, which is almost three times as large, at 1.3 billion people. And so, while 50% of European, US and UK adult populations have now been fully vaccinated, the figure for Africa is 1.8%, well behind India, which has only vaccinated 8% of its population. Due to the sluggish delivery of vaccines, the World Health Organization (WHO) now predicts that 47 of Africa’s 54 countries will miss even the very modest September target of vaccinating 10% of their citizens. In countries like Burundi, not a single vaccine has yet been administered.\\nAt these current rates there is no hope of Africa achieving the west’s vaccination levels this year or next. Unsurprisingly, African leaders speak of “vaccine apartheid”. While governments across the west get ready to administer booster vaccines, millions of Africa’s nurses and health workers, risking their lives to save others, will go wholly unprotected. So will Africa’s vulnerable elderly population.\\nThe vaccine programme should have been a new kind of “arms” race. In quick succession, country after country should have been able to inject its citizens. Instead, the countries with the most vaccines are failing to help those with the least, and now the damaging economic effects on jobs and livelihoods are causing a growing divergence between the fate of poor and rich countries. Low vaccination rates across the continent have led the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to mark down African economic prospects yet again, while upping those of the vaccinated west, and Africa is suffering growth rates that are half those of the rest of the world\\nThe African Vaccine Acquisition Trust (AVAT), disappointed by the failure of the west to honour its promises of delivering funding for 700m vaccines to Africa by the end of the year (the multinational Covax facility has been able to secure only 60m so far), has now taken matters into its own hands. It has negotiated a deal with Johnson & Johnson for 400m single-shot vaccines. In doing so, it had to overcome EU resistance. It was only after the South African president Cyril Ramaphosa intervened and threatened to ban all vaccine exports from South Africa that Europe agreed all J&J’s future African-produced vaccines could stay in Africa from October. Now 30% of Africa’s adult population are guaranteed vaccination, even though it will take until September next year.\\nBut vaccines are not yet available to meet Africa’s vaccination target, set at 60% of adults, or to cover that other 30% of people who were promised vaccines provided by the west. As a result, I am told the African Union has had no choice but to open negotiations with China to buy at least 200m Chinese-made vaccines. The hold-ups are now so serious that a vaccine “war room” has been created by the IMF, World Bank, WHO and World Trade Organization (WTO) to help track, coordinate and advance the delivery of vaccines. Despite this, only political leadership from the G7 countries, which have negotiated vaccines far in excess of their population numbers, will ensure that all continents receive an adequate supply.\\nThe world will manufacture around 6bn more vaccine doses by December and ramp up production by many billions more next year. This supply could be sufficient for every country to meet the 60% vaccination target by next summer. Problems that will perpetuate the inequalities in vaccine distribution can only be resolved with a level of global coordination that has so far been absent among G7 and G20 leaders.\\nThe Covid vaccines mean we can start living again – in Britain, at least\\nDevi Sridhar\\nRead more\\nTwo policy changes are urgently needed, which Joe Biden, Boris Johnson and Italy’s prime minister Mario Draghi, the G20 president, must now deliver at a special G20 vaccines summit that should be convened next month. First, a virtuous circle must be created, starting with guaranteed international funding from the richest countries, to underwrite and accelerate the development of new global manufacturing capacity in poorer countries. This would include expediting the transfer of technology through licensing agreements that would benefit from a temporary waiver on vaccine patents.\\nStill, Africa needs vaccines immediately. As things stand, the US has optioned 1.96bn additional doses. The European Commission has access to 1bn extra shots, while Canada has secured 191m (and at one stage had procured almost 10 vaccines per citizen). Due to over-ordering, their populations will probably not use all these vaccines, but in the process of securing preferential agreements rich countries have effectively locked out African countries from accessing the doses they urgently require. G7 leaders must now step in to ensure the supplies go where they are needed most. Countries with excess supply must end their stranglehold on available vaccines and future supplies. They must not only release them to Africa, but, as the IMF and four former American finance ministers proposed, provide at least $50bn in financial support through Covax and the logistical help needed to ensure vaccines can be administered quickly and safely.\\nEnsuring African populations have access to vaccines is not just an imperative for Africa. It’s in all our enlightened self-interest. As Britain’s leading vaccine scientist Sarah Gilbert has said, the biggest threat we all face is Covid spreading and mutating uninhibited in unvaccinated countries. We must keep reminding ourselves of the reason for ensuring the mass vaccination of the entire world: no one is safe anywhere until everyone is safe everywhere, and everyone will live in fear until nobody does.\\nGordon Brown is a former UK prime minister and author of Seven Ways to Change the World',\n",

       "  'Almost three out of five GPs reported managing patient expectations about vaccinations to be one of the most challenging issues of the pandemic, with multiple changes to vaccine eligibility requirements leaving many people confused and overwhelmed, the president of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, Dr Karen Price, said.\\nIn her foreword to the college’s Health of the Nation report, published on Thursday, Price said: “Unfortunately, some of these patients took their frustrations out on general practice staff”.\\n“Differing eligibility requirements across jurisdictions added to the strain.”\\nSchools should stay open as greatest risk of Covid transmission is in households, research finds\\nRead more\\nThe report is published annually and provides an insight into the state of general practice in Australia. It includes the findings of a survey of 1,386 GPs between April and May, of which 70% were in major cities, 20% inner-regional, 8% outer‐regional, and 2% remote and very remote.\\nOf concern to the college and exacerbating challenges of the pandemic is that not enough junior doctors are choosing a career as a GP, the report said.\\n“Our workforce is ageing, with the proportion of GPs over the age of 65 increasing from 11.6% in 2015 to 13.3% in 2019,” Price said.\\nAt the same time, not enough medical graduates want to be GPs. The proportion of final-year students listing general practice as their first-preference specialty has fallen to just 15.2% – the lowest since 2012.\\n“International medical graduates will continue to play a crucial role in bolstering the GP workforce; however, we must also grow our locally trained workforce,” Price said. “We also need more GPs to practise outside of major cities.”\\nGPs are also increasingly seeing patients with mental health concerns. For the fifth consecutive year, psychological conditions including sleep disturbance and depression were the most reported reasons for patient presentations to GPs. Over 70% of GPs selected “psychological” in their top three reasons for patient presentations, a number that has risen steadily from 61% in 2017, the report said.\\n“To help these patients in need, we need new Medicare items for longer mental health consultations so we can really get to the bottom of what is going on,” Price said. Of the survey respondents, 26% ranked Medicare rebates as their highest priority.\\nPrice called for more secure, long-term funding from the federal government, saying; if the government is serious about boosting the general practice workforce of the future so all patients can continue to access high-quality general practice regardless of where they live, it is vital that this is reflected in long-term funding arrangements”.\\nThe report found GPs in rural and regional areas are more likely to report a deterioration in their work–life balance compared with GPs in metropolitan areas, while GPs in Victoria are the most likely to report a negative effect on their wellbeing, with more reporting effects on their work–life balance and physical health compared with GPs in other states.\\n“This likely reflects the impact of Victoria’s prolonged Covid-19 lockdown in 2020,” the report found.\\nIn a speech to launch the report, the Greens leader, Adam Bandt, urged a one-off blitz starting next year to clear urgent public hospital surgery lists that have been under pressure during Covid, and supported calls from premiers for a fairer federal-state split for hospitals funding to boost public hospital resources.\\nState health departments this month called for commonwealth crisis funding to help manage the expected pressure on hospitals as restrictions ease across the country and Covid-19 infections spike.\\nBandt said the cost of these measures could be covered by abolishing the private health insurance rebate, which he said would return $59.4bn to the public health system over a decade, which could be spent on getting mental and dental health into Medicare.\\nBandt said the Greens would pursue these policies in balance of power after the next election if a minority Labor government is elected.\\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\\n“Each year, the public hands $6.7bn to the private health sector, where four big corporations control 70% of the market and make large profits off the back of public largesse,” he said.\\n“There are better ways of spending $7bn a year than giving handouts to big corporations … We want to stop giving handouts to the billionaire corporations in the private health industry, and put that money back into the public health system.”\\nThe Royal Australian College of General Practitioners rural chair, Dr Michael Clements, said everyone deserves to be able to access a good GP, no matter their postcode. The report showed promise for the future of rural medicine, with two out of five (44%) GPs in training reporting that they intend to work in urban areas post-fellowship, a larger proportion (48%) plan to work in rural or a mix of urban and rural locations.\\nClements said the trend was promising for the future of rural general practice, despite considerable challenges.\\n“Of course, we know this is not the reality – in many parts of rural and remote Australia the shortage of GPs is at crisis point,” he said.\\n“We know that the lack of access to high-quality healthcare is impacting people’s health and wellbeing. People in rural and remote communities are less healthy overall and experience higher rates of chronic conditions and shorter life expectancies.”',\n",
       "  'So far, more than 50% of young people aged 16-17 have taken up the Covid-19 vaccine, and this autumn the rollout is being extended further, with those aged 12-15 being offered jabs. Additionally, 16- and 17-year-olds can now book online for the first time, having previously had their shots at walk-in centres or through their GPs.\\nThese age groups are being encouraged to get vaccinated because, while older people are more at risk of becoming seriously ill with Covid-19, some healthy young people have become very unwell too.\\nNot only does vaccinating these age groups help protect individuals by reducing the chances of them catching Covid-19 or becoming seriously ill, it also benefits the wider community by helping prevent the spread of the disease.\\nThe young people in these age groups are eligible for one dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine – although those with prior health conditions that put them at increased risk from the virus will be advised to receive two doses.\\nPaediatrician Dr Bob Phillips\\nYou will find more information on the Covid-19 vaccination for young people on the gov.uk website – but here, with the help of paediatrician Dr Bob Phillips, we answer some key questions about the vaccine, its safety, and why the vaccine is good for your family and the wider community.\\nWhy should my son or daughter get vaccinated?\\nWhile Covid-19 is mild or asymptomatic in most young people, it can be very unpleasant for some, and one dose of the vaccine provides them with good protection against severe illness and hospitalisation. Vaccinating 12- to 15-year-olds should also help reduce the need for them to have time off school, potentially improving their mental health and wellbeing.\\n“If we can cut down the number of people who have the infection, there are fewer people to pass it on to others,” says Phillips. “And so the infection doesn’t go through the population. Illnesses we’ve done this with in the past include smallpox and measles.”\\nIs the vaccine safe for young people?\\nSince December 2020, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine has been given to millions of people in the UK. Following a rigorous review of the safety, quality and effectiveness of the vaccines in those aged 12-15, the independent medicines regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), has confirmed that it’s safe and effective. The UK has also benefited from data from the US, Canada and Israel, where young people aged 12-15 have already been offered the vaccine.\\n“The evidence we have so far suggests the risks of disease are still going to be greater than the risks of having the vaccine,” says Phillips. “The side effects you get from the vaccine are, essentially, a sore arm and perhaps feeling a bit shivery. All vaccines have very small risks of non-local side effects of different sorts, but the numbers are very small.”\\nHow were the vaccines developed so quickly?\\nAll Covid-19 vaccines have gone through three stages of clinical trials, and have been tested on tens of thousands of people around the world. The trial phases were run in parallel, which sped up overall vaccine production – but, crucially, didn’t result in a reduction in critical research time.\\n“All the normal safety checks were done, but the schedule was enormously speeded up,” says Phillips. “Instead of the process being run like it was business as usual, development of Sars-CoV-2 vaccines went to the top of everybody’s lists. The infrastructure to do this already existed, but in this case it was used in a more efficient way.”\\nHow does the consent process work?\\nFor those aged 12-15, the jabs are being rolled out in schools and colleges, with information and consent letters sent out in the same way as for other vaccines.\\nParents, guardians and carers will be asked for their consent, and the idea is that they make the decision jointly with the young person. The information leaflet each young person receives encourages them to discuss the matter with their parents.\\nIf a parent does not return a consent form, but the young person wishes to have the jab on the day of the vaccination session, they might be considered mature enough to provide their own consent – although every effort will be made to contact the parent for verbal consent.\\nYoung people aged 16 and 17 do not need parental consent.\\nWhat if a parent or carer declines the vaccine for a young person?\\nSome 12- to 15-year-olds will be considered mature enough to provide their own consent. Healthcare professionals from the immunisation teams have plenty of expertise in vaccinating young people, and will be responsible for assessing whether a young person has enough understanding to self-consent.\\n“If a parent declines the vaccine, providers might look into why, and try to address their concerns,” says Phillips. “But it is also possible for a competent [younger person] to agree to an intervention that they and a doctor or clinical practitioner think is right for them. This has been the general rule for years.”\\nIf no consent is received, and the young person is not competent or doesn’t want to be vaccinated, they won’t receive the vaccine.\\nCan a young person with allergies go ahead?\\nThere are very few young people who can’t receive the vaccine. The vaccine leaflet will have all the safety information you need, including a link to more detailed information about health conditions that may prevent a young person from receiving one. All young people and their parents or carers should consult their clinician if they have concerns regarding allergies.\\nWhat side effects can my son or daughter expect?\\nLike all medicines, vaccines can cause side effects. Most are mild and short term, and not everyone gets them. Very common side effects of the Covid-19 vaccine include, in the first day or two, tenderness in the arm, feeling tired, headache, aches and chills. Young people may also experience flu-like symptoms.\\nWorldwide, there have been reports of rare cases of inflammation of the heart, called myocarditis or pericarditis. These have been mainly in younger men, and within a few days of a second dose. Most felt better having had rest and simple treatments.\\nYoung people aged 16 and 17 can now book an appointment at nhs.uk. Find out more about vaccination at gov.uk.

The process for delivering the jab in schools and colleges will follow that for other vaccines.\\nThe Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine has been recommended for this age group by all UK chief medical officers, and the MHRA has concluded that it’s safe and effective for people aged 12-15.\\nOne dose of the vaccine is 94% effective against hospitalisation, and offers protection against serious illness. The vaccine also reduces the chances of transmission among extended family and support networks.\\nVaccinating your 12- to 15-year-old will help keep their school life on track and minimise the risk of disruption due to the need to self-isolate.\\nConsent of a parent or guardian will always be sought before a young person is vaccinated.\\nClear, advice about the risks and benefits will be provided, and local school age immunisation services will mediate if young people and parents disagree. Those aged 12-15 can decide to be vaccinated if they understand the benefits and risks, and are deemed capable of consenting themselves.\\nAny young person who misses the school vaccination session will still be able to get a jab in a follow-up programme.\\nIf you have questions about the vaccine, please speak to your local school age immunisation service.

       "  'In response to Christopher Cheetham’s letter (21 September), I do not wish to disparage his sentiment of promoting the international availability of vaccines, but I must disagree with his proposed action. Refusing a Covid booster in the UK is not the way to increase the availability of vaccines in the world. Such action will only lead to wasted doses. Furthermore, an undervaccinated population will put an increasing strain on the NHS, and places our physically nearest and dearest at greater risk. Greater production of vaccines and their coordinated distribution internationally has to be a better answer.\\nDr Stephen Mullin\\nConsultant clinical neuropsychologist\\nDeclining a booster could lead to vaccines being wasted rather than sent overseas. I, and many others, would be happy to donate our boosters if tests showed we didn’t need it, according to research by Imperial College. Without this, my inclination is to have the booster to protect my own and others’ health, and reduce the demands on the NHS.

       "  'When Joe Biden announced sweeping federal coronavirus vaccine requirements for 100 million Americans, the White House was braced for objections from Republican opponents.\\nBut this being 2021, the rightwing backlash has gone way beyond mere political debate into the realm of incendiary language that, analysts fear, could translate into direct and violent action.\\n‘Have at it’: Joe Biden dares vaccine mandate opponents to take him on\\nRead more\\nIn South Carolina, Governor Henry McMaster vowed to fight “to the gates of hell to protect the liberty and livelihood of every South Carolinian”. Tate Reeves, the governor of Mississippi, tweeted: “The vaccine itself is life-saving, but this unconstitutional move is terrifying.” JD Vance, a conservative running for a Senate seat in Ohio, warned: “Only mass civil disobedience will save us from Joe Biden’s naked authoritarianism.”\\nAnd the rightwing media went further, casually tossing around terms such as “authoritarian”, “fascist”, “totalitarian” and “tyrannical” to characterize the US president’s mandate that all employers with more than 100 workers require their employees to be vaccinated or test for the virus weekly.\\nThe rhetoric is seen as dangerous in a febrile political atmosphere that incited a deadly insurrection at the US Capitol in Washington on 6 January and plans for another extremist protest at the same location on Saturday. This week US Capitol police arrested a man in a truck who was armed with multiple knives, a bayonet and a machete near the Democratic National Committee headquarters.\\nKurt Bardella, a Democratic congressional campaign committee adviser, said: “After what we saw in this country on January 6, ‘civil disobedience’ is code word for violence and acts of terror when it comes to the Republican party. So many in this party are trying to whitewash the events of January 6, have referred to those behind it as ‘patriots’ and have gone so far as to suggest that those who have been incarcerated for their crimes should be released.\\n“The only conclusion that one can draw from their ongoing rallying cries for what they call ‘civil disobedience’ is that it is a call for more violence, more mayhem, more destruction, and solidifies the reality that the Republican party is a domestic terrorist organisation.”\\nThe battle over vaccine mandates is the latest development in a corrosive culture war over the efforts to stop the spread of the highly contagious Delta variant, now causing 150,000 cases and 1,500 deaths a day. This politicisation had led to the burning of masks, physical altercations at schools and even the booing of former president Donald Trump when he advocated vaccines to his own supporters.\\nBiden’s intervention last week was seen as a turning point where he replaced the carrot with the stick and finally got tough with the unvaccinated who are needlessly prolonging the pandemic. He said: “We’ve been patient, but our patience is wearing thin. And your refusal has cost all of us.”\\nJoe Biden announces his plan to boost Covid-19 vaccinations at the White House in Washington last week. Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock\\nThe White House is confident that it has the majority of the public on its side. Three in five Americans support the new mandates for private companies and federal government workers, according to an Axios/Ipsos poll this week. Media reports suggest that many employers quietly welcome the cover that Biden’s move will give them to ensure their staff are vaccinated.\\nBut that did not prevent a furious and unhinged casting of the president as a dictator. Matt Walsh, a podcast host, told the Fox News host Tucker Carlson: “We had to elect this rotting bag of oatmeal to get a real tyrant … Maybe this, in the end, is a good thing, in the sense that it’s a time for choosing for Americans … Are we going to comply and lie down to this, or are we finally going to stand up and say, ‘You know what, it’s not gonna happen’?”\\nFox News ran online headlines such as “BIDEN IS AN AUTHORITARIAN” and “BIDEN DECLARES WAR ON MILLIONS OF AMERICANS”. Its website has since published an article about an army lieutenant colonel resigning in protest over the Covid-19 vaccine mandate and what he described as the “Marxist takeover of the military”.\\nThree Republican governors tipped as presidential candidates in 2024 took their cue. Kristi Noem of South Dakota said she was preparing to go to court. Greg Abbott of Texas called it an “assault on private businesses”. Ron DeSantis of Florida said: “I do not believe that people should lose their jobs over this issue, and we will fight that.”\\nMore than 208 million Americans have received at least one vaccine dose but some 80 million remain unvaccinated. There are now about 300% more new daily Covid-19 infections, about two and a half times the hospitalisations and nearly twice the number of deaths as at the same time last year.\\nGovernor Henry McMaster of South Carolina has vowed to fight Joe Biden’s vaccine mandates ‘to the gates of hell’. Photograph: Meg Kinnard/AP\\nIn that context Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution thinktank in Washington, finds the Republican stand baffling and bewildering. “It’s dangerous for others and it’s dangerous for themselves,” she said. “How many rightwing talkshow hosts have already died of Covid? It’s actually fairly inexplicable. I can certainly see getting wrought up over taxes or freedom or going to war or all the other things the state does – but giving vaccines?\\n“This is crazy, frankly. There’s just no other word for it than crazy. The Republican party’s been taken over by crazy people. All these people who are doing this, their children have gotten polio vaccines, measles, mumps, rubella. All babies in the United States get their shots and that is mandatory. It is mandatory to go to school. So this is pretty insane.”\\nThere is little sign of Biden backing down. In a visit to a school in Washington last week, he accused the Republicans governors of being “cavalier” with the health of young Americans, and when asked about those who would file legal challenges, he replied: “Have at it.”\\nIt remains unclear whether the rightwing sound and fury will affect more than a section of the Trump base. David Frum, a former speechwriter and special assistant to President George W Bush, tweeted: “How’s that mass civil disobedience campaign against vaccine mandates going? Only 2% of human-resource professionals surveyed say they have noticed any instances at all of employees quitting rather than be vaccinated.”',\n",
       "  'Joe Biden has announced that the US will donate an additional 500m Covid-19 vaccines to low- and middle-income countries around the world, bringing America’s total global donation to more than 1.1bn doses.\\nThe US president outlined the plan on Wednesday at a virtual coronavirus summit where he urged world leaders to “go big” in tackling the pandemic and closing the vaccination gap with poorer nations.\\nThe meeting on the margins of the UN general assembly offers Biden a chance to exercise soft power and gain an edge on rivals such as China in “vaccine diplomacy”.\\nIn June Biden announced that the US would buy and donate half a billion Pfizer vaccines to 92 low- and lower-middle-income countries and the African Union through Covax, the global vaccine initiative. These have begun to ship, though the logistical challenges of distribution and storage are considerable.\\nOn Wednesday Biden promised more and urged other countries to step up. “The United States is buying another half-billion doses of Pfizer to donate to low and middle income countries around the world,” he said. “This is another half-billion doses that will all be shipped by this time next year.\\n“And it brings our total commitment of donated vaccines to over 1.1bn vaccines. Put another way, for every one shot we’ve administered to date in America we have now committed to do three shots to the rest of the world.”\\nBiden reiterated his pledge that “America will become the arsenal of vaccines, as we were the arsenal for democracy during World War II”.\\nBut he added pointedly: “We need other high-income countries to deliver on their own ambitious vaccine donations and pledges.”\\nHe announced a new EU-US partnership to work more closely together on expanding global vaccinations. He said the participants should commit to “donating, not selling” vaccines to low-income countries “with no political strings attached”.\\nVirtual attendees included the UN secretary general, António Guterres, the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, the South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa, the Indonesian president, Joko Widodo, and the WTO director general, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala.\\nBiden told them the summit was about “supercharging” efforts to dramatically increase vaccine production and deal with logistical challenges, addressing the “oxygen crisis” in many hospitals around the world, improving access to testing and personal protective equipment, and making the global health security infrastructure more resilient.\\nThe US alone has lost more than 670,000 people to the coronavirus, he noted, and the worldwide death toll is above 4.5m. “We’re not going to solve this crisis with half-measures or middle of the road ambitions. We need to go big and we need to do our part – governments, the private sector, civil society leaders, philanthropists. This is an all-hands-on-deck crisis.”\\nBiden was hosting the virtual summit amid scrutiny over why he is promoting a third vaccine dose for US citizens at a moment when less than 2% of people in developing countries have had their first shot.\\nAhead of the meeting, a group of Democratic senators including Tina Smith, Tammy Baldwin and Elizabeth Warren wrote to Biden urging him to make firm commitments to expand global Covid-19 vaccine access and lead the world out of the pandemic.\\n“According to experts, 11bn Covid-19 vaccine doses are needed to vaccinate 70% of the global population and significantly reduce the spread of the virus,” the senators, joined by two representatives, wrote in the letter. “So far, 5.82bn doses have been administered globally, but less than 2% of the population living in low-income countries received even one dose.\\n“Clearly, there is an inequitable distribution of Covid-19 vaccine doses, and it is getting worse. Despite promises and pledges from some wealthy countries to donate nearly 1bn doses to the global effort, only 15% of those donations have actually been distributed.”\\nMédecins Sans Frontières (MSF) urged the US and other high income countries to immediately redistribute their excess vaccine doses to low- and middle-income countries via the Covax facility and regional procurement mechanisms.\\nMSF also said the US government must demand that Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna share Covid-19 mRNA vaccine technology and knowhow so other manufacturers can make additional mRNA vaccines and meet the global needs.\\n\\nDr Maria Guevara, MSF international medical secretary, said: “The longer the world is divided into Covid-19 haves and have-nots, the longer the pandemic will drag on, the more variants can develop, and the more deaths and suffering will occur.”\\nThe summit underscores Biden’s attempt to put the US back in a global leadership role after the “America first” nationalism of the Donald Trump era. China announced this week that it has delivered 1.1bn vaccine doses to more than a hundred countries, although experts have questioned the effectiveness of these vaccines.\\nEric LeCompte, executive director of Jubilee USA Network and a UN finance expert, who is attending the summit, said in an interview: “It’s amazing that the Biden administration is filling a leadership void but we cannot move quickly enough from our perspective for two reasons. There’s the moral case that developing countries are experiencing a fourth wave of the pandemic and people are dying in the streets. We have to save lives.\\n“But there’s also something that is equally important: if we are not focused on getting shots in arms in the developing world, more variants are going to come to the United States and we will face a continuing health crisis. Perhaps even more significantly, we’ll continue to experience severe economic shocks all over the world in the years to come.”',\n",

France was one of the first to move towards mandatory vaccination for health workers this summer, with Greece making vaccinations mandatory for nursing home staff in July and healthcare workers from September.\\nOn Monday Greece also introduced mandatory weekly testing for public and private sector employees who will have to pay for weekly tests or carry a vaccination certificate to gain access to their place of work.\\nIn Canada the approach has been more piecemeal with British Columbia announcing in mid-August that it is mandating Covid-19 vaccines for all staff working in long-term care homes and assisted living facilities, the first Canadian provinces to do so.\\nItaly has decreed health workers, including pharmacists, who are not inoculated could face suspension without pay for the rest of the year.\\nWhat about government employees elsewhere?\\nCanada said on 13 August it would soon require all federal public servants and many other workers to be vaccinated. The vaccine mandate will also include air, train and cruise ship travellers. Fiji has been even more stringent, announcing on 15 August that unvaccinated public servants would have to go on leave.\\nWhere are we on vaccine passes for venues such as nightclubs and restaurants?\\nWhile Boris Johnson’s government flip-flopped wildly on the idea of vaccine passports for nightclubs before ruling them out, they have been adopted elsewhere. In Greece as part of new measures only vaccinated customers are allowed in bars, cinemas, theatres and other enclosed spaces.\\nFrance made it mandatory to show a Covid pass at cafes, bars and restaurants as the country battled a new wave of coronavirus infections, with the vaccine pass seen as contributing to flattening that surge.

       "  'L\\nast week my 13-year-old daughter “S” was offered the Covid vaccine at her school in England. I consented, as required, but made it clear that the final decision about whether to go ahead was hers. By this age, she is aware and responsible enough to be making decisions about her own body, with support, and crucially, clear information about what will be happening and why.\\nWe are a pro-vaccination family, although we have friends who aren’t – we have chosen to stay off the topic with them. My daughter is at an age where she seeks out a lot of information online, so I directed her to some websites to read up more widely about it, while emphasising the reasons why it was my strong preference for her to have the vaccine. S’s 15-year-old cousin was targeted outside school by anti-vaxxers a few weeks ago. When that happened, both S and her cousin were dismissive of the anti-vax arguments, and they thought gathering outside schools was totally inappropriate. These aren’t isolated incidents, sadly: this week there have been further reports of “sinister” anti-vax protests at schools in Liverpool.\\nOn the day S was due to get her vaccine in school, we had a final discussion about it. “Some of the kids are saying they won’t have it because they can’t see how it helps them,” she told me. “But I think that there’s a benefit to me being able to see grandma without worrying about infecting her. And I can’t face school closing again, so I’m a bit stressed, but I’m going to do it.”\\nAs a paediatrician, I believe it’s right to vaccinate young people aged 12 to 15\\nRussell Viner\\nRead more\\nTake-up at the school was low, partly because there was an issue with the consent form being difficult for some parents to access. Ultimately, S was the only child in her class to have the vaccine, with about 20% of her entire year group taking it up. She came home with a sore arm and slight headache, but other than that she was fine. She said that the vaccination team talked her through what was going to happen, and double-checked that she was sure before they went ahead.\\nAll was well until the following day, when another child in her class declared that because S had the vaccine, that meant she had now been injected with Covid – so if anyone went near her she would pass Covid on to them. This resulted in several children moving away from her, and refusing to sit beside her during lessons or at lunchtime.\\nS came home extremely distressed and confused. Believing, rightly, that having the vaccine means that she’s safer in terms of transmission than the other unvaccinated children in her class, she wondered why she was the one to be singled out by an ill-informed child?\\nI contacted the school, who quickly assured me that they would sort this out, particularly as they want to encourage more vaccine take-up. But it’s not hard to imagine that other children in the class, having seen what happened to my daughter, will now be wary of getting the vaccine for fear of being singled out.\\n\\nI very much doubt that my daughter is the only child in the country to have received this kind of reaction from schoolmates. On top of that, there are the pressures some children will be facing from their families not to have the vaccine, often because of concerns that it may not be safe for young people.\\nI’m worried that part of the reason for a slow uptake of the vaccine among 12 to 15-year-olds is that their issues around it are not being addressed adequately: there’s a sense that they are just being tacked on at the end of the successful adult rollout. They need to be addressed directly and clearly, and their concerns listened to. I’ve seen a lot of “what I need to know about my child and the vaccine” articles for parents in recent weeks, but there don’t seem to be many equivalents for 12 to 15-year-olds to read themselves. Reels and videos on social media help, particularly those made by people in the same age group, but surely there needs to be more official – and factchecked – dedicated communications for teens who may have concerns about the vaccine.\\n\\nWe live in the north-west, one of the worst-hit places in the country for Covid, and my daughter remains proud that she has played her part in tackling the virus. However, she still spent the weekend worried about going back into school as she felt that she was now a social pariah – thankfully this didn’t turn out to be the case. She says that she would have had the vaccine anyway if she’d known this was going to happen, but I’m not quite so sure. Social pressure in school can be difficult to handle.\\nThere are reports that the education secretary is considering writing to every individual in this age group to urge them to be vaccinated. That’s a start, but there needs to be a far stronger campaign to ensure that as many young people as possible get vaccinated – and they can do so without misinformation, anti-vax intimidation or fear of bullying.\\nThe writer lives in the north-west of England',\n",

And then one day she sent out a reminder that in Tennessee, children over the age of 14 may choose to be vaccinated without asking their parents first.\\nAnd she lost her job.\\nNow Fiscus, whose fate was seized upon as an example of the costs of speaking up for vaccines in a deeply red state, is strongly backing Joe Biden’s recent defense of vaccine mandates – something that has prompted howls of outrage from many conservatives but which Fiscus believes will save lives.\\nFiscus, who was fired in July, said the mandates make a lot of sense, and there’s a long precedent for creating rules to protect both our health and the health of those around us. In fact, vaccination mandates have been around since the US was founded.\\n“I think it’s absolutely the right thing to do,” Fiscus told the Guardian. It was “the right decision, and this will be on the right side of history”.\\nShe compared it to requirements to wear seatbelts, use car seats and drive sober. “There were a lot of people that were doing those things without laws, but there were a lot of people that still refused to do them even though the science was very clear that those were activities that were in the best interest of the good of the public. So now we have laws.”\\nPublic health officials, who before the pandemic generally worked in quiet obscurity, have faced violence and threats on their lives and livelihoods even as they work long hours for months on end. Some have resigned to protect themselves. Some, like Fiscus, have been removed from their jobs. By her count, 40% of state and territorial immunization program managers have left or been pushed out during the pandemic. Others continue working, but they keep as low a profile as possible.\\nFiscus has watched the attacks on Biden’s new stance with disappointment. Tennessee’s governor, Bill Lee, joined others in immediately responding negatively to vaccine mandates, calling them a “terrible idea” and a “power grab”.\\nThe mandates around vaccines and testing have “come under a lot of attack, by the GOP primarily, but really, this is what needs to be done”, Fiscus said. “When you have a pandemic that is out of control, and you have a safe and effective mitigation strategy to stop that pandemic, and you have a population that is unwilling to do the right thing to get it to stop – it does take a leader to make some hard decisions about how that’s going to be handled.”\\nShe believes the vaccination mandate will increase inoculation rates, especially in places like Tennessee, which has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the country. “There’s very good data to show that if you put in requirements like this, people will comply with it,” she said. When California abolished philosophical exemptions from childhood vaccines, she pointed out, vaccination rates climbed.\\nAnswering questions about vaccines’ safety and efficacy was also “critically important”, she said. “There are lots of people who opt into getting regular, routine vaccinations who are still holding out on Covid [vaccines], and it’s because they’re scared.”\\nFiscus, a pediatrician who serves on the board of the American Academy of Pediatrics, says that pediatricians have decades of valuable experience addressing questions about vaccines’ safety and efficacy. “We can dispel the myths and the misinformation that they might have.”\\nFiscus is measured when she speaks about her firing. When asked about what happened to her in July, she said carefully: “We’re still trying to figure out how all of this happened.”\\nThe state contends that she was let go because of her performance, unrelated to a memo she sent outlining Tennessee law on vaccinating minors.\\nFiscus said she was just doing her job, which was informing the public about vaccines. And she points out the laws still on the books in Tennessee state that children over the age of 14 are allowed to decide if they want to get vaccinated.\\n“My firing changed nothing,” she said.\\nThen, there’s the muzzle. Fiscus said she received a muzzle in the mail days before she was fired. The state closed its investigation in August, saying the muzzle was bought through an Amazon account under Fiscus’s name – strongly implying that she sent the package to herself.\\nBut Fiscus said it was an additional account created by someone else, fraudulently using her credit card with an incorrect billing address and an out-of-state phone number. An investigator with the Nashville police fraud unit “already uncovered some details that were omitted from the state’s investigation”, she said, and the case is still evolving.\\nFiscus and her husband have lived in Tennessee for 24 years. It’s where they raised their children; her husband is on the Williamson county school board. They loved their town. But now, she said, “we have watched this community devolve into something that we don’t recognize.”\\nNow, she wonders who sent her that muzzle. Public health officials who have been harassed and threatened can’t help but view their neighbors in a new light. Was it someone she might bump into at the grocery store? Someone who might confront her husband outside his school board meetings?\\nBut Fiscus isn’t giving up. “I desperately want to go back into public health. I won’t be doing it in Tennessee,” she said wryly. But in two weeks, she’ll move to the Washington DC, area in the hope of continuing to shape health policy.\\nShe is ready for a new start. But that new life will, paradoxically, involve much of the same: continuing to advocate for proven ways to end the pandemic and protect our lives and wellbeing – including measures like vaccination mandates.\\n“We have a runaway train of a pandemic. We have a tool to stop it,” Fiscus said. “People have got to be part of that solution.”',\n",
       "  'Melbourne will go from the world’s most locked-down city to almost entirely free of restrictions next month, but the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, has warned that a significantly expanded “vaccinated economy” will remain for 2022.\\nVictoria is expected to reach an 80% vaccination rate for those aged 16 and older from Friday – a week ahead of the date forecast – and hit the 90% (for those aged 12 and older) mark by 24 November.\\nThe state recorded 1,935 new cases on Sunday, and 11 more deaths. The state is now at 73% full vaccination for those aged 16 and older (increasing at a rate of about a percentage point a day), but the number of people in hospital (787, up from 770 on Saturday), intensive care (146, compared to 144 on Saturday) and on a ventilator (93, 90 on Saturday) also continues to climb.\\nThere are now 24,993 active cases in the state.\\nFrom 6pm on Friday, travel will be allowed throughout the state, and all retail businesses will reopen, subject to density requirements. Masks will no longer be required outside, and all children will return to learning in the classroom full-time.\\nOn Sunday Andrews said he hoped the changes would allow those in Melbourne, who have not been able to leave the city since July, to enjoy a long weekend to coincide with the Melbourne Cup public holiday on 2 November.\\nVictoria to scrap quarantine for fully vaccinated international arrivals\\nRead more\\nAndrews also outlined the state’s plans when it reached a 90% vaccination rate. There would be no caps on any activity, and masks would only be required in the most high-risk settings. He hoped the first day of the 2021 Boxing Day Test would set a record for an Australian crowd since the pandemic started, and said Christmas would go ahead without restriction for those who were vaccinated.\\n“There is a fundamental agreement that we have reached with the Victorian community. We asked you to get vaccinated. You have done that in record time and record numbers,” Andrews said.\\n“That means we have to open the place up and we have to have a series of rules, we have to have settings, that are the lightest touch possible, the simplest, the most easily understood, that are as close to normal life as possible.\\n“That is what we committed to and that is what we are going to deliver.”\\nUnlike in New South Wales, where those who are unvaccinated will largely be allowed the same freedoms as those who are vaccinated from December, Andrews expects to keep restrictions limiting the activities of the unvaccinated throughout next year.\\nThose restrictions were expanded on Sunday, when Andrews made clear that non-essential retail and events would be vaccine mandated, effectively banning those who are unvaccinated from attending or working in those settings. Mandates already existed in numerous settings including some essential retail, construction, aged care and health.\\nAndrews confirmed this meant that those who were unvaccinated would be banned from attending anything from a bookshop to a pub to a football game until at least 2023.\\nHe said this shift was largely because the unvaccinated continued to be the biggest burden on the health system. Of the 146 people in intensive care with Covid-19, Andrews said 93% were unvaccinated.\\nAndrews said he expected to make an announcement soon with his NSW counterpart, Dominic Perrottet, about a further easing in travel restrictions between the states.\\nIn NSW, there were 296 new cases and four deaths recorded on Sunday.\\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\\nSign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\\nThe rate of people aged older than 16 who have received at least one dose has reached 93%, and the rate of full vaccination for the same age group is 84.4%.\\nThe number of people in hospital has increased from 469 on Saturday to 480, but the number in intensive care has fallen from 123 to 119.\\nOn Sunday, Perrottet and the NSW tourism minister, Stuart Ayres, announced a new campaign to sell the state to domestic and international visitors as it reopens.\\nThe campaign goes beyond Sydney’s iconic opera house and harbour bridge to sell other parts of the state, Ayres said.\\n“They are exceptionally beautiful. There’s no doubt about that. But this campaign is about moving a bit beyond them to be able to say they’re always going to be there,” he said.\\n– with Australian Associated Press',\n",
       "  'The UK government is to pull out of a deal with the French pharmaceutical company Valneva to buy its Covid-19 vaccination, the company has said.\\nThe move will come as a blow to the vaccine manufacturing site in Livingston, west Scotland, which was visited by the prime minister, Boris Johnson, in January.\\nAbout 100m doses of the yet-to-be-approved vaccine were put on order after the UK increased its request by 40m in February. But in a U-turn, the government has served notice to terminate the contract over allegations of a breach of the agreement.\\nScotland’s health secretary, Humza Yousaf, told BBC Good Morning Scotland: “This is a blow for the facility in Livingston. We are very keen and will be reaching out to the company to try to get security and secure a future for that facility in Livingston; we hope that would be with Valneva.\\n“Clearly, when it comes to their supposed alleged failure to meet their contract obligations, we obviously are looking for more information from the UK government and would expect that shortly.”\\nThe Livingston MP Hannah Bardell said: “This has come as a huge blow to my constituency, in which the facility is based. I will be working closely with Valneva – who have worked tirelessly on developing a vaccine to supply across the UK and indeed the world – to secure a future for the facility and the jobs it was due to create in Livingston and the surrounding area.\\n“I have written to the Speaker of the Commons and tabled an urgent question to ensure this issue gets the attention and scrutiny it deserves. I will be challenging the UK government on this decision – they must provide details as to why the contract has been cancelled and ensure there is a future for the site, Valneva’s vital work and their staff.”\\nValneva shares tumbled by about 40% in early trading on Monday. In a statement, the company said: “Valneva SE, a speciality vaccine company, today announced that it has received a termination notice from the UK government (HMG) in relation to the supply agreement for its Covid-19 vaccine candidate, VLA2001.\\n“The contract provides HMG with the right to terminate. HMG has alleged that the company is in breach of its obligations under the supply agreement, but the company strenuously denies this.”\\nUnder the agreement between the government and Valneva, the UK can terminate the contract early in a relatively wide range of circumstances.\\nThey include “material safety issues” with Valneva’s vaccine, evidence that it lacks efficacy, or a breakdown in supply. Financial difficulties such as insolvency and debt default, as well as a takeover of the company, can also trigger termination, although none of these appears to be the case.\\nThe government can also tear up the contract if Valneva is found to have committed fraud or bribery, as well as over breaches of environmental, social or labour law, or non-compliance with tax law. Some of the triggers that allow the government to terminate the deal early have been redacted in the supply agreement.\\nValneva declined to comment further on the reasons for the dispute. The Guardian has approached the government for further comment.\\nThe vaccine candidate was in phase 3 trials, the company said, with results due in the fourth quarter.\\n“Subject to these data and MHRA [Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency] approval, Valneva believes that initial approval for VLA2001 could be granted in late 2021,” the company said.\\n“Valneva has worked tirelessly, and to its best efforts, on the collaboration with HMG including investing significant resources and effort to respond to HMG’s requests for variant-derived vaccines. Valneva continues to be committed to the development of VLA2001 and will increase its efforts with other potential customers to ensure that its inactivated vaccine can be used in the fight against the pandemic.”',\n",
       "  'Three million children aged between 12 and 15 will be able to get their first shot of coronavirus vaccine from next week. The UK’s four chief medical officers (CMOs) have said they should be offered a first dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.\\nSo what are the benefits, what are the risks, and do children need to be vaccinated?\\nWhat exactly has been recommended and why?\\nThe UK’s CMOs are recommending vaccines for 12- to 15-year-olds on “public health grounds” because it is “likely vaccination will help reduce transmission of Covid-19 in schools”.\\nThey added: “Covid-19 is a disease which can be very effectively transmitted by mass spreading events, especially with the Delta variant. Having a significant proportion of pupils vaccinated is likely to reduce the probability of such events which are likely to cause local outbreaks in, or associated with, schools.\\n“They will also reduce the chance an individual child gets Covid-19. This means vaccination is likely to reduce (but not eliminate) education disruption.”\\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) previously said Covid presented a very low risk for healthy children and jabs would only offer a marginal benefit.\\nHow did the JCVI and CMOs reach different decisions?\\nThe JCVI’s Prof Wei Shen Lim says there is “no conflict” between its advice and that of the CMOs, adding that the CMOs had looked at jabs from a much wider perspective.\\nEngland’s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, said the CMOs “think on balance the benefits both at an individual level and in terms of wider indirect benefits to education and through that to public health are in favour, otherwise we would not be making this recommendation”.\\nSo do children need the Covid vaccine?\\nSince the start of the pandemic, evidence has repeatedly shown children are highly unlikely to become seriously ill with Covid-19. Data from the first 12 months of the pandemic in England shows 25 under-18s died from Covid.\\nHowever, that does not mean children are immune to the virus. Some will fall ill, and for those that do, there is the additional risk of long Covid, which could have lifelong consequences.\\nEven before the first lockdown, there have also been concerns about the indirect effects of the virus on children. The biggest has been the disruption to schools, which had a severe impact on their mental and physical health, as well as their education.\\nThat, essentially, is why the four CMOs have said children aged between 12 and 15 should be eligible for the jab.\\nThey believe that being vaccinated will reduce the risk of disruption to school and extracurricular activities and the effect of this on their mental health and wellbeing.\\nWhat are the benefits?\\nA single dose of Pfizer will significantly reduce the chances of a young person getting Covid and passing the virus on.\\nThe Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health says a jab is likely to benefit healthy children, irrespective of any direct health benefit, because it will enable them to have less interruption to school and allow them to mix more freely with their friends.\\nGetting vaccinated will also give more protection to friends and family members whose health may be at risk from the virus. This extra protection will not only benefit those around the children, but could also indirectly benefit them. For instance, a vaccinated child is less likely to pass the virus to a parent, which means there would be less of a risk the parent may become too sick to properly look after their child.\\nOffering vaccines to children could also help reduce the anxiety some children feel about Covid-19.\\nHow much protection does one jab give?\\nClinical evidence shows that a single dose of Pfizer cuts the risk of catching the Delta variant of Covid-19 by 55% and has a much greater effect on preventing severe illness and death. It also cuts transmission.\\nWill the jab hurt?\\nNo. There could be some side-effects, though. The most common in children aged 12 to 15 are similar to those in people aged 16 and over.\\nThey include pain at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Any effects are usually mild and improve within a few days.\\nWhat are the risks?\\nThe risks are minimal. The vast majority of children who have had the jabs worldwide have not suffered any serious side-effects.\\nData from the US and Canada suggests a higher rate of the extremely rare event of inflammation of the heart muscle, known as myocarditis. However, this was only after a second dose.\\nThe JCVI has been asked to look at whether second doses should be given to children and young people aged 12 to 15 once more data comes through internationally.\\nCould getting a jab affect a child’s future fertility?\\nThere is no evidence the Covid-19 vaccines have any effect on the chances of becoming pregnant or having children. False and misleading claims about Covid vaccines and fertility are still circulating online, however, despite being unsupported by evidence.\\nDoctors are very cautious about recommendations during pregnancy, so the original advice was to avoid the jab. However, there is now so much safety data after a year of vaccines being administered that this advice has changed and the vaccine is now actively encouraged, particularly as getting Covid can itself put a pregnancy at risk.\\nThe Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has also said: “There is no evidence to suggest that Covid-19 vaccines will affect fertility and your ability to have children.”\\nThe MHRA said it reached this conclusion because its “expert scientists and clinicians continually monitor the safety of Covid-19 vaccines and rigorously review all reports of suspected side effects, as well as other sources of safety information”.\\nWhat if a child has already had Covid?\\nMore than half of children of secondary school age may have some natural immunity after having been infected.\\nHowever, although people do get an immune response after contracting Covid, this varies from person to person and it depends on whether they had a mild infection or a more severe infection.\\nResearch shows many of those with a very mild or asymptomatic infection may only form very low levels of antibodies. That is why it is recommended that even if someone has been infected, they should still get a jab, because it then serves as a boost to the immune system.\\nHow will the jabs be provided?\\nThe School Age Immunisation Service will deliver the bulk of the programme in schools, with separate vaccination sites used for pupils where this is not possible.\\nDo parents need to give consent?\\nYes. If a child is offered a vaccination at school, a consent form may be handed out to give the permission of a parent.\\nThe nurse or GP will discuss the Covid-19 vaccine at the appointment and be able to answer any questions. But parental consent may not be the last word if the child is considered competent to make a decision by themselves.\\nWhat if a child wants to overrule their parent?\\nChildren can overrule parents who do not want them to get the jab. However, Whitty said for the “great majority of cases, children and their parents come to the same decision”.\\nThe vaccines minister, Nadhim Zahawi, said: “In the rare event that there is a situation a parent does not consent but the child or the teenager wants to have the vaccine, then there is a process by which the school-age vaccination clinician will bring initially the parent and the child to see whether they can reach consensus and if not, if the child is deemed to be competent, then the vaccination will take place.”\\nWhat about other children?\\nAll 16- and 17-year-olds are already being offered a first dose, with the intention of having a second at a later date. Those aged 12 to 15 are eligible for two doses if they are at higher risk of a number of issues.\\nWhitty has said there are “no plans at the moment” to look at vaccinating under-12s.\\nWhere can I find more information?\\nThe government has published a guide for children and parents online.',\n",

       "  'Full federal approval of Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine will empower businesses and universities to require vaccinations and tip hesitant Americans toward getting the jab, the surgeon general, Dr Vivek Murthy, said on Sunday.\\nBreakthrough infections and booster shots: what you need to know\\nRead more\\n“We already know that there are many businesses and universities that have moved toward vaccine requirements,” Murthy told CNN’s State of the Union. “And I think it’s a very reasonable thing to do to create a safe environment.”\\nThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is trying to finish its licensing process for the lifesaving drug as soon as Monday, the New York Times has reported.\\nUntil now, the Pfizer shot has been administered under an emergency use authorization, though experts continue to emphasize that it is safe and effective.\\n“We’ve given it to hundreds of millions of people,” Murthy said. “We’ve seen that it’s doing its job. And that’s why we’re continuing to recommend that people get vaccinated starting today and … as soon as they can.”\\nAs the highly infectious Delta variant spreads, the US is experiencing a surge in Covid-19 cases. Many southern states are struggling for hospital capacity amid resistance from Republican leaders and the public to vaccinations and mask mandates.\\nThe overwhelming majority of Covid hospitalizations and deaths in the US are among unvaccinated people.\\nAs health misinformation continues to dog the pandemic response, some have started self-medicating with a form of ivermectin intended for horses, which the FDA has warned could lead to hospitalization.\\n“The best protection we have against Covid-19 is the vaccine, and if you get Covid-19, we actually do have treatments that work,” Murthy said.\\n“Ivermectin is not one of them.”\\nWith the start of a new academic year, students across the US are returning to crowded school campuses.

       "  'Headteachers have described the “sinister” intimidation tactics being used by protesters against the vaccination against Covid of teenagers in schools.\\n“It started with a few emails from a group calling itself Lawyers for Freedom,” the Guardian was told by the headteacher of one of a number of Liverpool schools that have come under pressure from anti-vaccine activists. “An email is relatively easy to ignore.”\\nRising number of anti-vaxxers ‘willing to take direct action against schools’\\nRead more\\nThe protests soon escalated, however, with “aggressive” leafleting of pupils by five or six protesters as they left school. The head dialled 999, but the police did not come.\\n“It felt disproportionate,” said the head. “We know there was at least one student who came back into school and was quite upset by what was going on.”\\nThat was followed by a visit from a small group of protesters who gained access to the school, demanded to meet the head, then served quasi-legal documents warning that they would be held legally responsible if any child suffered death or harm from these “experimental vaccines”.\\nThe same has happened at a number of Liverpool secondary schools. The encounters were typically filmed on a mobile phone then posted on the social media app Telegram by a group calling itself Liverpool’s People’s Resistance UK, naming schools and in some cases teachers, declaring, “Notice served.”\\nA spokesperson for Merseyside police said it was aware of reports of anti-vaccination protesters targeting Liverpool schools and headteachers. Officers had advised headteachers on how to manage the incidents and to contact the force immediately when they occur.\\nThe local authority had also been in contact with secondary schools in Liverpool and has advised headteachers on how to ensure the safeguarding of pupils and staff, the spokesperson added.\\n“It was pretty aggressive,” the Guardian was told by the head. “They came up to reception asking to speak to the headteacher about a legal matter. They insist on reading from a script and they film the whole process on a mobile.\\n“Once they’ve handed the papers over, they tend to disappear. They’ve got the footage they want. It almost feels like it’s a trophy. There are Trumpian undertones to what these groups are doing. If they started describing themselves as patriots, I wouldn’t be surprised.”\\nThe numbers of protesters involved is hard to pin down. An investigation by the Liverpool Post found that parents appeared to be contacting a group administrator called George to arrange for a visit and for papers to be served on their school. Having visited the school, they then boast about frightening teachers and at one point say about a headteacher: “She can’t run, she can’t hide.”\\nThe head who spoke to the Guardian said he thought that some of the anger was from disenfranchised parents who were using the vaccine to pursue other grievances with their school. “To what extent the vaccine is a contributory factor, I don’t know,” he said. “What these sorts of groups are doing is saying, ‘We can do things. We can intimidate schools.’ It is sinister. Headship is a challenging enough vocation as it is. I fear what intimidation of this nature might do to future headship recruitment.”\\nA spokesperson for the Association of School and College Leaders agreed there were “sinister undertones” to what was happening in Liverpool, but they had not heard of this kind of organised activity elsewhere.\\nElsewhere, anti-vaccine protesters have caused distress to pupils and staff while picketing school gates. Pupils at St Thomas More Catholic School in Blaydon, Gateshead, were distraught after anti-vaccine protesters showed them pictures of what appeared to be dead children.\\nThames Valley police were investigating reports that a teacher was verbally abused by protesters at Beaconsfield School, one of a number of anti-vaccination protests at schools in Buckinghamshire. In Kent, police have been asked to lay on extra patrols after pupils were targeted by protesters.\\nA government spokesperson said: “It is never acceptable for anyone to pressurise or intimidate pupils, teachers or the wider school community, and protesters engaging in this type of behaviour should immediately bring it to an end. The police and local authorities have a range of powers available for managing protests at a local level and these can be used where appropriate.”\\nSupt Pete Steenhuis of Kent police said: “We respect that everyone has a right to peaceful protest and will balance these rights against the potential for disruption outside Kent and Medway schools.”\\n\\nPaul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, called for protesters to behave more responsibly. “Whatever your views on vaccination, it is never OK to make children feel scared and intimidated as they arrive at school.\\n“People have the right to express their concerns, but this must be done appropriately. Schools are not the place for angry protests. We would urge anti-vaccination campaigners to behave more responsibly and to carefully consider the impact their actions are having on children.”',\n",

The rest of the country can now operate relatively freely, with mask requirements and some restrictions on gathering size. The total number in the outbreak is now 996.\\nThe director general of health, Dr Ashley Bloomfield, said health officials were interviewing the driver to find out if there were locations of interest.

The issue is so pervasive that the Medical Council of NSW has published guidelines around the strict criteria for exemptions. President of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, Dr Karen Price, says vaccine misinformation was driving requests, but that doctors are approaching the issue sensitively. “I’ve heard numerous stories of GPs who’ve had frank discussions with hesitant patients and have allayed their fears by providing evidence-based information, and they’ve gone on to receive the vaccine,” she said.\\nAngus Taylor has revealed that cabinet is yet to approve some of the trade-offs the Nationals sought from the Liberals in return for formally supporting a net zero by 2050 target. Taylor said specific details of the deal would be made public after cabinet gave them the green light – raising the possibility that the Nationals signed on before elements of their wishlist were fully approved. Meanwhile the government has refused to release modelling underpinning the new 2050 plan, which has been denounced as a “political scam” and roundly criticised for its lack of detail and ambition.

       "  'Business owners vowing to ignore the New South Wales government’s push to require people to be fully vaccinated to enter shops, bars or restaurants are unlikely to find the law on their side, an expert says.\\nOn Wednesday, the NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, reaffirmed her commitment to the double-dose vaccination requirement in the government’s reopening roadmap.\\nThe plan, released last week, suggests fully vaccinated people will be able to attend venues that have been forced to close during the state’s lockdown, including bars, gyms and sporting events, once 70% of the adult population is fully vaccinated.\\n“At 70%, if you’re not vaccinated, it will be a health order and the law that if you’re not vaccinated, you can’t attend venues on the roadmap,” the premier said. “You can’t go into a hospitality venue. You can’t go to ticketed events unless you are vaccinated. We made that very clear.”\\nBerejiklian has also not ruled out restrictions on unvaccinated people once NSW hits an 80% double-dose rate, warning vaccine-hesitant residents they will not be able to “let everybody else do the hard work and then turn up” for equal freedoms.\\n“What I also said that day is that we’re considering what 80% double dose looks like because, then, what we need to consider is not only what the unvaccinated population could do to our hospital system but the rate at which disease can still spread if too many people are unvaccinated,” she said on Wednesday.\\nBut the proposal has faced some backlash from business owners online and among the minority of vaccine-hesitant residents opposed to receiving the jab.\\nOn social media, anti-vaccination groups have pushed the idea of non-compliance, while Guardian Australia has also reported concerns from some business owners who say making them responsible for enforcing a vaccine mandate places an unfair burden on staff.\\nBerejiklian was pushed by reporters on Wednesday on whether the NSW government had obtained advice both on the legality of mandating vaccinations and on the requirement for businesses to enforce any rules.\\nThe premier said the government would “need to seek legal advice”, saying it was in “uncharted territory”.\\n“We receive advice from a myriad of sources every step of the way and what people choose to do individually is on them in terms of legal issues, but I will say this – our job is to provide certainty and safety to the community but also to see both patrons enjoying their freedom,” she said.\\nNSW businesses may face bumps on the ‘roadmap to freedom’ out of lockdown\\nRead more\\nBut experts have said the government would be on solid ground in its attempts to mandate vaccinations for certain freedoms.\\nWhile the NSW government is currently facing legal challenges to some of its public health orders, including rules requiring police officers and healthcare workers to be vaccinated, Dr Ron Levy, an associate professor at the Australian National University’s college of law, said the legal prospects for people opposed to vaccine mandates was “quite poor”.\\n“I just don’t see a lot of limits, legally speaking,” he said. “People want to find them because they might strongly believe their freedoms are being constrained, but legally speaking they’re not going to find what they’re looking for.”\\nWhile some groups, including the Australian Human Rights Commission, have raised the prospect of discrimination laws affecting vaccine mandates, Levy said they could only apply in extremely limited cases since personal opposition to vaccines was not a form of discrimination.\\n“In very rare cases people might not able to have a vaccination for medical reasons so there could be an argument of discrimination on the basis of disability, but what is very, very likely is that any order or law is going to have exemptions for those sorts of people, anyway,” he said.\\nThe legal landscape was less complicated in NSW, Levy said, because the state does not have a Human Rights Act. In the states and territories that do – Victoria, the ACT and Queensland – legislators would have to consider the human rights implications of any rules which limited access to places on the basis of vaccine status.\\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\\nSign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\\nThe Australian Human Rights Commission for example has warned that vaccine passports “may have significant implications for privacy and autonomy, freedom of movement and association, equity and discrimination, particularly when it comes to accessing everyday goods and services”.\\nBut Levy said courts would always conduct a balancing act when it came to people’s rights, using the saying “your freedom to swing your fist ends where my nose begins”.\\n“That’s what this is all about … you have the freedom to not put something in your blood or muscle but on the other hand if you want to go out into society with other people who are immunocompromised or disabled or just don’t want to potentially die from Covid, those peoples interests are also important.\\n“So that’s the balancing act that needs to be done. There are almost no absolute rights other than torture and genocide most rights are definitely just the starting point of the discussion.”',\n",
       "  'Pfizer has been accused of holding Brazil “to ransom” over demands to shield itself from possible vaccine side-effect lawsuits in its contract to supply the country with 100m Covid jabs.\\nIn its $1bn (£700m) deal with Pfizer Export BV, signed in March, despite its prior complaints, the Brazilian government agreed that “a liability waiver be signed for any possible side-effects of the vaccine, exempting Pfizer from any civil liability for serious side-effects arising from the use of the vaccine, indefinitely”.\\nIndemnity from compensation claims has been common in contracts between many countries and big pharma companies since the late 1980s.\\nThe contract also stipulated that Brazil would cede to US courts, convened secretly, in the event of any contractual disputes relating to the vaccines.\\nIn April, the contract was leaked on the health ministry website – a confidentiality agreement with Pfizer prevents the publication of its contracts. It was removed soon after and went largely unnoticed outside Brazil until the information was tweeted by a French lawyer and writer last month.\\n“Purchaser hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Pfizer, BioNTech, [and] each of their affiliates … from and against any and all suits, claims, actions, demands, losses, damages, liabilities, settlements, penalties, fines, costs and expenses … caused by, arising out of, relating to, or resulting from the vaccine,” reads the contract.\\nEchoing AstraZeneca’s acrimonious row with the EU, the Brazilian government had previously complained about Pfizer’s stipulation “that if there is a delay in delivery, there is no penalty”. But it agreed in the contract that while Pfizer would “use commercially reasonable efforts to meet the delivery schedule” it would ultimately, “under no circumstances be subject to or liable for any late delivery penalties”.\\nThe leak also revealed that Brazil agreed not to “use the name, trade name, service marks, trademarks, trade dress or logos” of Pfizer in “publicity releases, advertising or any other publication” without its “prior written consent” in each instance.\\nThe Bureau of Investigative Journalism reported in February that Pfizer had demanded Brazil and Argentina put up sovereign assets as collateral to guarantee indemnity, as well as create a guarantee fund with money deposited in a foreign bank account. Pfizer said it had not interfered “with any country’s diplomatic, military, or culturally significant assets”.\\n“Everyone already knows about Pfizer’s clauses,” said the then health minister, Eduardo Pazuello in January. “I guess I don’t need to repeat it, but I’ll be succinct: complete disclaimer for side-effects from today to infinity. That simple. Brazilian courts waive any legal action on the company. That simple. [In addition to] Brazilian assets abroad available as collateral and long-term deposit for future actions abroad.”\\nThe contract further reveals that Brazil elicited much cheaper jabs from Pfizer than the EU, at about $10 (£7) a dose, while the pharmaceutical giant upped the number of doses it pledged to provide.\\nCampaigners said Pfizer had exhibited behaviour suggesting it was more interested in protecting profits than safeguarding the public.\\nVials of Pfizer vaccine. The company’s $1bn contract with the Brazilian government to supply 100m vaccines has been criticised for its liability waivers. Photograph: André Penner/AP\\nAlena Ivanova, campaigns officer at Global Justice Now, said: “Pfizer is all too happy to cash in on publicly funded coronavirus vaccines, but doesn’t want to take on any of the risk. It’s an all too familiar move from pharmaceutical companies that seem more interested in protecting their profits than protecting the public.\\n“We can’t keep putting our faith in private companies to provide lifesaving medicines, only to see them hold countries to ransom.”\\nAs required by domestic law, the government released online all vaccine acquisition contracts, except those from Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer due to the confidentiality clauses. Pfizer has been credited with saving untold lives with its vaccine but has also faced criticism for the disparity of its rollout after it prioritised higher-priced sales in richer countries.\\nArthur Rollo, the former national consumer secretary at Brazil’s justice ministry, said it was “absolutely questionable to keep an administrative contract confidential”.\\nHe added: “The public administration has a duty of transparency, even more in times when there is suspicion of embezzlement in the purchase of vaccines. To the extent that Janssen [Johnson & Johnson’s subsidiary] and Pfizer say their contracts are standardised, it doesn’t seem reasonable to require this secrecy clause because you can’t compare whether the contract is the same or not in other countries.”\\nFrench lawyer and writer Juan Branco, who posted the contract on Twitter, said that since the production cost of a Pfizer vaccine is believed to be a maximum of $2 (£1.50), the legitimacy of the profits should be questioned. “This debate can’t happen if the public and the citizens are kept out of the loop,” he added.\\nPfizer’s Covid vaccine sales brought in $3.5bn (£2.5bn) in the first three months of this year, nearly a quarter of its revenue. Pfizer/BioNTech aims to produce 3bn doses by the end of this year and 4bn in 2022. Analysts have forecast revenue of over $6.6bn (£4.8bn) for the Pfizer/BioNTech shot in 2023, according to Reuters, mostly from boosters.\\nA man receives a Covid vaccine at a health centre in Joinville, Santa Catarina.

Those leading the investigation believe Bolsonaro’s administration was “negligent” in not buying vaccines in 2020 while pushing ineffective drugs such as chloroquine, and that lives could have been saved had the government acted earlier.\\nAt a televised congressional inquiry in May, Pfizer’s Latin America president, Carlos Murillo, said indemnity clauses were operative in more than 110 countries and rejected claims the company had been exploitative.\\n“In this pandemic, Pfizer, in an unprecedented situation, wanted everyone to collaborate with this process. For this reason, it defined the same conditions for all countries as it did for Brazil,” he said.\\nOxygen firms accused of intimidating Mexican hospitals during pandemic\\nRead more\\nPfizer spokesperson Sharon Castillo said indemnification clauses were common in public health emergencies. “In the context of bilateral negotiations, Pfizer and BioNTech have no intention of interfering with any country’s diplomatic, military, or culturally significant assets, and any suggestion to the contrary is misleading and factually incorrect,” she said.\\n“Pfizer has a collaborative relationship with governments with which it has negotiated bilateral contracts,” she said. “As a result, the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine has reached more than 120 countries and territories in every region of the world.\\n“In all our contracts, Pfizer/BioNTech are deploying a pricing structure for high, middle, and low/lower-middle-income countries,” she said.\\n“Pfizer has self-funded its Covid-19 vaccine. The company deployed $2bn before even knowing if the vaccine would be successful because we understood what was at stake. Just recently, we authorised spending an additional $600m on Covid-19 research and development that will bring our total spend for research and development in 2021 to more than $1bn.\\n“We take adverse events that are potentially associated with our Covid-19 vaccine very seriously.”\\nBrazil’s health ministry said it was abiding by the “confidentiality rule” and could not comment.',\n",

One big change: Moderna’s booster will be half the dose that’s used for the first two shots, based on company data showing that was plenty to rev up immunity again.\\nFor J&J’s single-shot vaccine, the FDA said all US recipients should get a second dose at least two months following their initial vaccination.\\nThe FDA rulings differ because the vaccines are made differently, with different dosing schedules – and the J&J vaccine has consistently shown a lower level of effectiveness than either of the two-shot Moderna and Pfizer vaccines.',\n",

NHS leaders are understood to have been briefed on the plans after schools were told to be ready to introduce the programme.\\nThe move follows the conclusion of a review by the chief medical officers (CMOs) of all four nations, led by Chris Whitty.\\nWhen asked to confirm the plan, a Department of Health source said ministers had not received final advice from the CMOs and did not want to prejudge them.\\nLast week, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) said children would receive only marginal health benefits from a mass vaccination campaign but did not consider the potential benefits to children’s education.\\nSome Tory MPs had said they would oppose vaccinations for children without definite medical and scientific evidence in favour and a green light from the CMOs.\\nSources indicated that the government may be moving against the idea of vaccine passports, despite culture secretary Oliver Dowden last week indicating strongly it was pressing ahead. Vaccine passports are due to be introduced in Scotland next month.\\nOn Saturday night, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, confirmed that he would set out the next steps of the government’s programme to control the virus “shortly”.\\nHe is also expected to repeal powers in England that ministers regard as no longer necessary from the Coronavirus Act, as part of its plans to manage Covid over the autumn and winter.\\nPowers to be scrapped will include those to close down sectors of the economy, such as business premises, and apply restrictions to events and gatherings, as well as powers that disrupt education.\\nSome powers from the act that are seen as critical to protect and support the public will, however, be retained. These include giving sick pay to those isolating from day one rather than day seven, directing schools to remain open if they close against government guidance, and helping the NHS to get the emergency resources it needs.\\n“These extraordinary times required necessary but intrusive measures,” the prime minister said. “But I’m determined to get rid of any powers we no longer need because of our vaccine defences.”\\nMinisters are likely to confirm that the booster jabs can go ahead for double-vaccinated adults alongside a mass promotional campaign. They have been waiting for guidance from the JCVI, which in turn has been waiting for a study at the University of Southampton to report on the safety of a third jab.\\nJonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said: “With hospital admissions climbing and high levels of virus in circulation, we need to go further on vaccination.\\n“Any decision on jabbing children is rightly for the medical experts and we anticipate the CMO will outline the next steps imminently.\\n“The NHS is under intense pressure, so ministers must ensure if the green light is given this week that the infrastructure including primary care and health visitors is in place to speedily roll out these vital next stages of vaccination.”\\nMeanwhile, clinical trials are under way for next-generation vaccines which may protect against variants.\\nA version of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine intended to protect against both the Beta variant and the original Wuhan strain is being tested, and the first results are expected in the autumn, possibly as soon as next month.\\nThe government says the best analysis shows the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is 96% effective and the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine 92% effective in preventing hospitalisation after two doses.\\nMinisters confirmed last week that those who are immunocompromised will be offered a third primary dose. This is separate from the booster programme, as those who require a third primary dose had insufficient protection from two doses.\\nThe winter Covid plan will be marked by delay, confusion and ignorance.

This worryingly persistent and flawed approach ignores the hazardous and evolving nature of the virus,” he writes.\\nBuildings need to be modified to improve ventilation, he says, and the public should be encouraged to wear properly designed masks that may protect them as well as others.\\nJonathan Ashworth: ‘With hospital admissions climbing and high levels of virus in circulation, we need to go further on vaccination.’ Photograph: UK Parliament/Jessica Taylor/PA\\n“All too often, messaging has been aimed at transferring responsibility to individuals. Pointing the finger at people who are obese, are reluctant to be vaccinated, or are unlucky enough to have severe underlying conditions and telling them to be ‘cautious’ is no substitute for what has been missing all along – an effective strategy for getting the virus under control.”\\nPaul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said he believed the big surges of Covid were probably past.\\n“A substantial proportion of unvaccinated people have had the infection already and are as protected as though they have been double-jabbed and probably even better protected against severe disease,” he said.\\n“So we are probably very close to the endemic equilibrium. You can see this by looking at the current geographical distribution of cases. Those local authorities with the highest incidence are generally those that have escaped relatively lightly up until recently.\\n“Although I can’t be certain, I do not expect there to be a big surge in cases as a result of schools going back or universities starting term in a couple of weeks’ time.”\\nBut he said he was nervous about rising numbers of people in hospital and the possibility of a flu epidemic during the winter.\\n“Most epidemiologists, like myself, think we are due a bad year because we have not seen much flu for over 18 months and so immunity will be low.”\\nThat could lead to substantial pressure on the NHS, and falling ill with flu and Covid at the same may double the risk of death, he added.\\nLinda Bauld, a behavioural scientist at the University of Edinburgh, said there were signs that infections were levelling off but the new school year in England might see rises, as had happened in Scotland.',\n",
       "  'Members of the government’s expert committee on vaccination remain largely opposed to extending Covid jabs to younger teenagers, despite politicians having signalled they would like to see a shift in the guidance, the Guardian has been told.\\nSeveral members of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) said the mainstream sentiment on the body is still extremely cautious about expanding the programme to 12- to 15-year-olds, even though a deputy chief medical officer has suggested that outcome is high probable and politicians have said they would like the issue to remain under review.\\nThe JCVI recommended on Wednesday that all over-16s be offered jabs, just two weeks after saying children should not routinely be given Covid vaccinations. The U-turn provoked alarm at what was described as a “shambolic” vaccine rollout for older teenagers, with doctors saying they were being “left in the dark” about the details of the rollout to younger people.\\nThe JCVI has moved to “refresh” the membership of its Covid subcommittee in recent weeks, with one prominent critic of Covid jabs for children, Prof Robert Dingwall, leaving the body.\\nDingwall and others on the committee said his views were not the reason for the shake-up, and that sentiment on the body is still that the risks outweigh the benefits for 12- to 15-year-olds. Three other members – Prof Lucy Yardley, Prof Liz Miller and Prof Bryan Charleston – also left at a similar time.\\nJonathan Van-Tam, a deputy chief medical officer, has said it was “more likely than less likely” that the list of eligible children would be broadened.\\nHowever, one expert who remains a member of the JCVI said the overriding opinion of the body was still against expanding vaccinations to 12- to 15-year-olds and argued that the committee was more likely to recommend removing categories of vulnerable children who are currently offered vaccines.\\nCommittee members said they had not felt political pressure to change their views when it came to changing its advice on 16- and 17-year-olds. However, two members on the committee said there had been a fear that Scotland could go its own way on vaccinating older teenagers, even though the Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has consistently said her government will follow JCVI advice.\\nDingwall, professor of sociology at Nottingham Trent University, told the Guardian that his leaving the JCVI subcommittee on Covid was nothing to do with his views about vaccinating teenagers. “People are seeing a conspiracy where none exists. This is something that has been prefigured for several weeks and it’s entirely coincidental that it happens to be at the same time as the review on vaccination for 16- and 17-year-olds.\\nThe risks and rewards of vaccinating UK children against Covid\\nRead more\\n“I am being portrayed as some kind of lone voice critic of vaccination for [teenagers] but at no point have my views been any different from the broad consensus on JCVI. This idea I’ve been a single roadblock is just nonsense,” he said. “I don’t feel that my absence is a great loss to JCVI and I have every respect for the integrity of colleagues.”\\nHis departure was reported by the Spectator on Thursday and sparked outrage in some quarters of social media, but Dingwall said his departure was to do with pulling more work back into the main JCVI committee.\\nDingwall was co-opted to the JCVI’s Covid-19 committee from the chief medical officer’s Moral and Ethical Advisory Group, of which he remains a member.\\nHe has previously expressed scepticism about vaccinating children, saying they were at “low risk for Covid” and suggested they might have been better protected by simply catching the virus. He has also written previously in favour of lifting Covid restrictions once the population is mostly vaccinated.\\nA JCVI spokesperson said: ‘The JCVI is a group of independent experts who discuss the latest available evidence to reach decisions on how to best use Covid-19 vaccines to protect the public. The main JCVI committee has provided all advice and recommendations to ministers on Covid-19 vaccines. The committee is united in its efforts to reach a consensus in order to provide robust advice to ministers on how best to continue preventing hospitalisation and deaths from Covid-19.”\\nAsked about Scotland’s role in the process, a Scottish government spokesman said: “The CMO [chief medical officer] wrote to the JCVI last week noting they faced ‘challenging decisions, often based on newly emerging or limited clinical data’ and thanked them for their endeavours to date. He outlined that he understood that the JCVI was this week set to consider further data on the issue. Dr [Gregor] Smith outlined that there was an urgency to these considerations ‘given the early return of schools in Scotland in mid-August’.”\\nThe spokesperson said Smith hoped the JCVI would say more about their consideration of the impact of Covid on the long-term health of young people.',\n",

We know that the vaccine is helping us to save lives and so we must focus all of our efforts on rolling out the booster campaign to everyone eligible, as well as ensuring that everyone who has not yet had their first jab, including young people, gets the chance to come forward.”\\nComplacency slowing England’s Covid booster jabs rollout, says NHS leader\\nRead more\\nBriefings in newspapers attributed to government sources have criticised the NHS for not getting more jabs delivered fast enough.

However only about 95m jabs will be needed to fulfil the expected demand of vaccinating all over-16s and giving a booster dose to the most vulnerable in autumn.\\nGiven the average level of take-up for adults who have received a first and second dose stands at just over 80%, if the same level was maintained for those eligible accepting all doses they are offered this year, that would leave a surplus of 210m vaccines. Even if take-up were 100%, the figure would be 186m.\\nThese leftover jabs would help inoculate the about 211 million people living in the world’s 10 least vaccinated countries, said campaign group Global Justice Now, which collated the figures.\\nNick Dearden, director of the organisation, told the Guardian it was an “insult to the thousands dying each day” that the UK was offering third doses and preparing to vaccinate teenagers while low- and middle-income countries were left “fighting for scraps”.\\nHe said the issue was compounded by the UK’s efforts to “obstruct” a temporary waiver of intellectual property rights on coronavirus vaccines. The bid was tabled at the World Trade Organization (WTO) in October 2020 by India and South Africa – and has since been backed by countries including the US, France and Italy.\\nMinutes from the most recent WTO meeting to discuss the proposal concluded that “disagreement persisted on the fundamental question of what is the appropriate and most effective way to address the shortage and inequitable access to vaccines”, with a decision now pushed back until October 2021.\\nDearden said the UK was “keeping the global south dependent on donations while hoarding limited vaccine supplies for ourselves” and called it an “obscene injustice”.\\nThe government’s drive to roll out third doses from next month flies in the face of a call by the World Health Organization this week for a moratorium on booster shots in a bid to vaccinate 10% of every country’s population by the end of September. It estimates at least 60-70% of the world needs to be inoculated to reach “global immunity”.\\nThe 10 countries with the smallest proportion of people vaccinated, according to Oxford University’s Our World In Data, are: the Democratic Republic of Congo (0.005%), Haiti (0.003%), Burkina Faso (0.01%), Vanuatu (0.03%), South Sudan (0.04%), Yemen (0.04%), Chad (0.04%), Syria (0.05%), Guinea Bissau (0.06%) and Benin (0.1%).\\nThe situation was akin to “vaccine apartheid”, said Max Lawson, Oxfam’s head of inequality policy. He told the Guardian: “The British government is ignoring the WHO’s advice, issuing booster shots and dogmatically defending vaccine patents. It’s only going to prolong the pandemic, leading to more deaths and, ultimately, to mutations of coronavirus that could undermine the UK’s own vaccination programme.”\\nShami Chakrabarti, a former Labour shadow attorney general, said the UK and other wealthy nations “have a responsibility to do all we can to save lives in the global south” but ministers were instead “closing down every avenue for low- and-middle-income countries to access vaccines with sufficient speed and scale”.\\n“For the government to see such suffering and impede every solution is an utter failure of common decency let alone human rights obligations,” she added.\\nA government spokesperson said: “The UK is committed to supporting a global recovery to the Covid-19 pandemic and improving access to vaccines.\\n“We have committed to donate 100m doses by June 2022, with the first deliveries starting last week. On top of this, UK funding is helping to provide more than a billion vaccines to low- and middle-income countries through Covax.”\\nThis article was amended on 9 August 2021. About 95m jabs will be needed to fulfil the expected demand of vaccinating all over-16s and giving a booster dose to the most vulnerable in autumn, rather than 256.6m as an earlier version said. It has also been amended to clarify that, while about 467m jabs are on order, only 306m are due to be delivered to the UK by the end of 2021.',\n",
       "  'S\\ncientists would make swifter progress in solving the world’s problems if they learned to put their egos aside and collaborate better, according to the leading researcher behind the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid vaccine.\\nProf Katalin Karikó, the senior vice-president for RNA protein replacement therapies at BioNTech in Germany, endured decades of scepticism over her work and was demoted and finally kicked out of her lab while developing the technology that made the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines possible.\\nThe vaccines Karikó helped to develop smuggle genetic material called mRNA into cells so they can churn out the coronavirus spike protein and prime the immune system to fight the disease. On Thursday, she was honoured with a $3m (£2.2m) Breakthrough prize for life sciences along with her colleague Prof Drew Weissman at the University of Pennsylvania.\\n“If so many people who are in a certain field would come together in a room and forget their names, their egos, their titles, and just think, they would come up with so many solutions for so many things, but all these titles and whatever get in the way,” Karikó told the Guardian.\\nKarikó grew up in Kisújszállás, 150km east of Budapest. Photograph: Csilla Cseke/EPA\\n“I always thought who cares? In 100 years nobody will know my name. But titles, promotions, older men, power, it all gets in the way,” she said. It is not exclusively men that prioritise power over progress, she concedes, but “they have had more time to practise wielding power”.\\nOver the course of the pandemic, Covid vaccines have saved hundreds of thousands of lives. New mRNA-based therapies in the pipeline aim to produce antibodies to viruses directly so protection arises immediately rather than taking weeks to build up. The immunity will be shorter-lived than that gained from a vaccine, but could protect doctors from outbreaks of new emerging diseases. Ultimately, she envisages people having freezers of mRNAs at home to help treat wounds, burns and other ailments.\\nKarikó grew up in Kisújszállás, 150km (93 miles) east of Budapest. Her family lived in a single room with a reed roof, no running water, no refrigerator and no television. She studied hard and at 14 came third in a national biology competition. She went on to university in Hungary, gained a postdoc, and then sold her car on the illegal market, sewed the money into her daughter’s teddy bear and moved the family to the US.\\nHer first position was a postdoc at Temple University in Philadelphia, which earned her $17,000 a year to support the family. “I know how to have a shoestring budget and not spend more than $30 a week on food for the family. That was our limit,” she said. After falling out with her boss, she moved to the University of Pennsylvania.\\nWhile mRNA therapies had clear promise, enthusiasm for the approach collapsed in the face of multiple failures. A major problem was that mRNAs triggered severe immune reactions when smuggled into cells. In 1995, Karikó was diagnosed with cancer and the same week says she was given an ultimatum by the university: either drop the mRNA work or lose her prestigious faculty position. She opted for the demotion – and a substantial pay cut – so she could carry on the research. Two years later, she met Weissman. Together they discovered how to get mRNA into cells without provoking severe immune reactions: the approach became the basis for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.\\n“People love to hate big pharma, but these people are so smart,” she said. “When I went from academia to a company, they don’t care how many committees you are on, how many papers you have. What counts is that you have a product that has an effect. The ego is wiped out. It is so much better.”\\nKarikó said she remained optimistic through the upheavals of her career by looking for the positives in every situation.\\n“You have to focus on what you can do. A lot of people get distracted and say, ‘oh he works less’, or ‘he got promoted’, or ‘he has more money’, and they immediately take their eye off what is important. They are focusing on things they cannot change. You work because you want to do the best you can do. If you think, ‘oh, I want to please my boss’, or somebody, there are reactions you cannot control, and that’s it, you’re already disappointed.\\n“If you are fired from your job you don’t panic, you think I’ll get a new opportunity. Everything has a positive, you have to find it.”\\nHer share of the Breakthrough prize means she is $1.5m better off than before. Though she was delighted, it was not the highlight of her year, she said. This month, the staff and residents of a residential care facility in New York got vaccinated with the Pfizer jab and declared 2 September Katalin Karikó Appreciation Day. A week later, the home had a Covid outbreak. Seventy tested positive but nobody died.\\n“They were so happy. Thanks to the vaccine, they are still there. For me, no award, no money you can put in my hand, could be worth more than that.”',\n",
       "  'India’s Covid vaccination rollout has continued to falter due to supply shortages and vaccine hesitancy, casting doubt on the government’s pledge to vaccinate the entire population by December.\\nA number of states, including the capital, Delhi, said they had run out of vaccine stocks this week while others including Odisha, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra said vaccine supplies were running critically low in many areas, particularly for those aged between 18 and 45.\\nManish Sisodia, the deputy chief minister of Delhi, tweeted that “vaccines have run out in Delhi again. The central government gives vaccines for a day or two, then we have to keep the vaccine centres closed for several days.”\\nThe central government has disputed the claims of shortages and said all states were informed weeks in advance how many vaccines would be sent to them each month.\\nVaccinating India, the second most populous country in the world with more than 1.3 billion citizens, is a gargantuan task. However, nationwide figures show that the country is nowhere near hitting the daily target needed to have the whole adult population vaccinated by the end of 2021, as was promised in May by a government minister, Prakash Javadekar.\\nOnly 5% of the population is fully vaccinated, while about 20% have had one dose.\\nMore than 8 million people need to be vaccinated each day to hit the target of 2.16bn doses administered by December, but on Sunday the turnout fell to 1.3 million, the lowest in months, and the daily average so far for July has been about 4 million.\\nFears of a third Covid wave hitting India in the next few months have added an urgency to the vaccination programme. While cases remain extremely low in the capital Delhi, one of the worst hit areas in the devastating second wave, there are still officially about 1,000 Covid deaths per day in India, with the real figure likely to be far higher. The central government has said it is monitoring an alarming rise in cases in states in the north-east and in Kerala in the south.\\nThe Indian Medical Association (IMA) warned on Monday that “the third wave is inevitable and imminent” and urged the government to limit tourist travel and religious activities and pilgrimages, which have picked up again in recent weeks.\\n“It is painful to note that in this crucial time, when everyone needs to work for the mitigation of the third wave, in many parts of the country, both governments and the public are complacent and engaged in mass gatherings without following Covid protocols,” said the IMA in a statement.\\nVaccine hesitancy has also been hindering the vaccine rollout, particularly in rural areas. In the impoverished state of Bihar, where vaccine hesitancy is rife owing to misinformation campaigns on social media and WhatsApp and fears vaccines will cause infertility or death, there have been reports of attacks on mobile vaccination centres. Local authorities have been offering villagers home appliances such as fridges and fans and even gold coins as incentives to boost the vaccination turnout.\\nYet hesitancy is also present among the educated elite, including doctors, some of whom are concerned in particular by the domestically produced vaccine Covaxin, which still does not have World Health Organization approval.\\nThe prime minister, Narendra Modi, has personally appealed to Indians to get vaccinated on his monthly radio show, and speaking at an event on Monday, the home minister, Amit Shah, also addressed the issue of vaccine hesitancy.\\n“No one should be under the impression that our fight is over – the only way to win this battle is 100% vaccination of the masses,” said Shah. “However, some communities are still hesitant in taking vaccines. People are not coming forward out of fear that the vaccine will adversely affect them.”',\n",
       "  'The UK’s vaccine advisory group behaved like a medical regulator in rejecting calls for all children aged 12-15 to be offered Covid jabs despite that not being its role, Prof Neil Ferguson has said.\\nLast week the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) said the margin of benefit for older children, on health grounds alone, was too small for the committee to support jabs for the entire age group.\\nBut it recommended that ministers seek further advice, taking into account factors such as the impact on disruption to education, with sources suggesting vaccines for older children could be recommended this week.\\nFerguson, a leading epidemiologist from Imperial College London whose initial modelling was pivotal in Britain’s coronavirus response, said he would not be surprised if the UK’s chief medical officers decide to press ahead with vaccinating healthy children aged 12 to 15.\\nSpeaking at an online event hosted by the Institute for Government, Ferguson said he understood that the JCVI had been relatively conservative in its advice, because of the small risk of a condition call myocarditis that appears to be linked to certain Covid jabs.\\n“I think the committee had some particular concerns about long-term follow-up data in terms of myocarditis associated with vaccination, and so took quite a conservative position, almost akin to a kind of medical regulator – which isn’t quite its role,” he said. He added that the UK’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) had already approved use of the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines for children over the age of 12.\\nFerguson also said he suspected Covid infection might pose a greater risk than the vaccine when it came to myocarditis, although he noted a lack of good data for estimating the risk of the condition from Covid.\\nNo 10 intent on keeping Covid powers amid expected rise in cases\\nRead more\\nOn Friday Jeremy Brown, professor of respiratory infection at UCL and a member of the JCVI, stressed that the role of the MHRA and JCVI were different. “MHRA make a broad decision about whether a product can be used in a given population – so they have decided that the vaccine is safe to use in this population, whether it’s necessary to use in a given population is to JCVI’s remit,” he said. “So the MHRA actually allow you to use a vaccine, and we say, well, do we need to? And the answer is no, not for healthy 12 to 15-year-olds, on health grounds.”\\nFerguson said there were wider benefits including that vaccinating younger people would drive down transmission and therefore help protect the vulnerable. “So long as you’re convinced that there is some individual-level benefit, then I think it’s valid to call in the population benefits,” he said.\\n\\nHe said the call on whether to offer the vaccine to all older children was “an enormously difficult decision” and he added he was not going to criticise the JCVI. But, he said, vaccinations of older children might yet go ahead. “It wouldn’t surprise me that the chief medical officers taking in account these other factors, decide to go forward with vaccination,” he said.',\n",
       "  'Healthy 12- to 15-year-olds could override their parents’ decision on vaccination in the right circumstances, a minister has said, as the UK government prepares to overrule advice and extend jabs to younger teens.\\nNadhim Zahawi, the vaccines minister, said parents of healthy 12- to 15-year-olds would be asked for consent if coronavirus jabs were approved for their children – expected to be pushed through by ministers this week.\\nBut he added that children could override their parents’ wishes “if they’re deemed to be competent to make that decision, with all the information available”.\\nHe told Times Radio: “What you essentially do is make sure that the clinicians discuss this with the parents, with the teenager, and if they are then deemed to be able to make a decision that is competent, then that decision will go in the favour of what the teenager decides to do.”\\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) decided against backing the move to extend the vaccine offer to younger teens on health grounds alone, since Covid-19 presents such a low risk to that age bracket. However, that decision is likely to be overruled by the UK’s chief medical officers, who will take wider considerations into account – such as disruption to education.\\nProf Peter Openshaw, a member of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag) which advises the government, told BBC Breakfast he was “a little surprised” at the JCVI’s decision.\\n“We do know the virus is circulating very widely amongst this age group, and that if we’re going to be able to get the rates down and also prevent further surges of infection perhaps later in the winter, then this is the group that needs to become immune,” he said.\\n“And the best way to become immune is through vaccination, and there’s never been as much information as this in the past. To think there hasn’t been enough research is completely wrong.”\\nZahawi said no final decision had been made. “We have not made any decisions, so we haven’t decided not to listen to the experts,” he said.\\n“On the contrary, all four ministers, the secretary of state [for health] Sajid Javid and his fellow ministers in the devolved administrations have agreed to ask the chief medical officers to convene expert groups, including the JCVI being in that, to be able to recommend which way we should go on healthy 12- to 15-year-olds.”\\nZahawi also confirmed vaccine passports will be required for nightclubs, mass events and large venues in England by the end of September, the vaccines minister has confirmed, saying that would allow businesses to stay open during the winter months if Covid-19 surges.\\nHe said the government wanted to “make sure the whole economy remains open” through the autumn amid fears that a return to school could set off a new wave of infections.\\n“We are looking at, by the end of September when everyone has had the opportunity to be fully vaccinated, for the large venues, venues that could end up causing a real spike in infections, where we need to use the certification process,” Zahawi told Sky’s Trevor Phillips on Sunday.\\n“If you look at what the FA have done, they’ve done so brilliantly in terms of checking vaccine status to reopen football. That is the sort of right thing to do and we are absolutely on track to continue to make sure that we do that.”\\nVaccine passports, which can be shown via the NHS app, have been fiercely opposed by some Conservative MPs. But Zahawi said Boris Johnson was committed to the plan.\\n“The reason being is that, I, as does the prime minister, want to make sure the whole economy remains open,” he said. “The worst thing we can do for those venues is to have a sort of open-shut-open-shut strategy because we see infection rates rise because of the close interaction of people, that’s how the virus spreads, if people are in close spaces in large numbers we see spikes appearing.\\n“The best thing to do then is to work with the industry to make sure that they can open safely and sustainably in the long term, and the best way to do that is to check vaccine status.”',\n",
       "  'As cases of the Delta coronavirus variant have risen and vaccination rates slowed, several US businesses and institutions have announced they will now require vaccinations from employees.\\nEviction crisis looms after Biden and Congress fail to extend Covid ban\\nRead more\\nMajor companies like Walmart and Disney said this week all employees must be vaccinated, while Joe Biden said all federal employees must be vaccinated or face masking, testing and distancing requirements.\\nSchools, universities, hospitals, financial services, tech companies, retailers, entertainment industries and local governments have announced similar policies.\\nThe efforts are supported by an opinion from the US Department of Justice, which says employers can require vaccines under emergency-use authorization.\\n“Overall, it’s legal to require vaccinations in the midst of an active, dangerous epidemic,” said Ross Silverman, professor of public health and law at the Indiana University.\\nIn France last week, President Emmanuel Macron said entrance to many public places would require a “health pass” showing proof of vaccination, prior infection or a negative test.\\nThe US government won’t mandate vaccines but states, cities and businesses can.\\nThe US has a long history of requiring vaccines. In winter 1777, George Washington required smallpox inoculations for all soldiers fighting the British. In 1809, Massachusetts passed a law requiring proof of inoculation against smallpox.\\nDr Ruth Faden, founder of the Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics, said: “If we look at the history of the ability of human beings to control infectious diseases, it’s hard to imagine how we would have been able to accomplish what we’ve accomplished in the absence of mandates of one sort or the other.”\\nWith measles and diphtheria, for example, “it was not merely the advent of the vaccine but the requirement that the vaccine be received … that made the difference.”\\nBy 1980, schools in all US states had laws requiring vaccinations for students. Some places offered religious or philosophical exemptions. Such rules were put to the test in a measles epidemic in Philadelphia in 1991, when 1,400 cases and nine deaths were mainly clustered in two churches whose members requested exemption from vaccination.\\n“Philadelphia was a feared destination,” said Dr Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and an infectious disease physician at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. “Schools canceled trips to the city. People were afraid to come.”\\nThe measles vaccine became compulsory. “Everyone in those schools had to be vaccinated, even though the parents didn’t want them to be,” Offit said.\\nOne pastor asked the American Civil Liberties Union to represent the churches but it declined, Offit recalled, on the grounds that “while you are at liberty to martyr yourself to your religion, you are not at liberty to martyr your child”.\\nIn 2019, New York mayor Bill de Blasio mandated vaccines following a measles outbreak in some religious communities.\\nIn the grip of the Covid pandemic, mandates seem a logical next step, experts say. Vaccines are safe and effective, widely available and more needed than ever as the Delta variant spreads.\\n“That’s where the rubber is about to meet the road,” Offit said, “because we cannot allow this to happen.”\\nAllowing the virus to circulate will put those not eligible for vaccination, like children, and those who not protected well, like the immune-suppressed, at risk. Unchecked spread means more variants will emerge, probably making vaccines less effective.\\n“We’ve done all of these things to try to encourage and make it as easy as possible and reduce as many barriers as possible to getting vaccinated,” Silverman said. “Yet we still have this gap in our protection that is causing significant risk to a large part of the population.”\\nThe risk isn’t just severe illness and death, Silverman added, but also long Covid, a debilitating condition.\\nVaccines won’t be compulsory. People may request medical or religious exemptions. It will be up to employers to approve or deny requests.\\n“It becomes a question of whether or not granting that exemption would create a severe risk in the work environment,” Silverman said.\\nIn hospitals and long-term care facilities, for instance, unvaccinated staff represent an enormous risk to their patients and residents and employers may deny exemptions in these circumstances.\\n“Workers may choose not to be vaccinated, but that may mean they’re no longer able to work in the same job.”\\nUnvaccinated retail or restaurant workers, on the other hand, might be able to use masks and testing.\\n“There’s no one way, there’s no gold standard, for how these things are being managed,” Silverman said. “What they’re going to do for Broadway may look very different from what the NFL is going to accept.”\\nSome states have passed laws limiting vaccine mandates. But companies may mandate vaccines because it’s the safest way to protect employees and customers and keep their business going.\\nThere’s also an ethical imperative to mandate vaccines, Faden said.\\n“There’s an awful lot of good, an awful lot of human welfare that could be promoted here, a tremendous burden of disease and death could be prevented.\\nUK can expect thousands of Covid deaths every year, warn scientists\\nRead more\\n“It’s not only our physical health that we’re concerned about. All of these things that make our lives go well are being threatened by this pandemic. And those people who are choosing not to be vaccinated are a large part of the reasons why all of these things that matter to us continue to be threatened.”\\nMuch like laws about wearing seatbelts and against driving distracted or drunk, vaccine mandates help the world function. As Faden puts it: “I can’t just go through a traffic light because I’m in a hurry.”\\nSome experts also hope mandates will encourage vaccination rates to increase.\\n“It’s going to be more inconvenient for a person on a weekly basis to have to get tested,” Silverman said. “You want this to be as easy as possible for people to say yes to.”\\nIn the US, vaccination rates are shifting back up.

       "  'Joe Biden’s new hard line on vaccine mandates in America has dropped in an already politically fraught environment, where some governors have banned requirements by education authorities that masks be used in schools even as many experts lament low rates of vaccination and some hospitals are straining under the pressure of the Delta variant of Covid-19.\\n‘Have at it’: Joe Biden dares vaccine mandate opponents to take him on\\nRead more\\nThe mandates will cover 80 million workers at large businesses and 17 million health workers across the US. Staff in healthcare systems receiving Medicaid and Medicare funding must be vaccinated, with rare exemptions for medical reasons. Businesses with more than 100 employees must require either vaccination or weekly testing. In addition, large businesses must offer paid time off for employees and their families to receive the vaccines and recover from any side effects.\\n“What we need is things that work right now,” Dr Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown School of Public Health, told reporters of the announcement from the White House. “So I actually think it will make a big difference.”\\nBut several Republican governors and leaders have already announced plans to sue the Biden administration for “unconstitutional” overreach, and there has been widespread anger and pushback from many influential and powerful conservative figures.\\nBiden’s move comes against a backdrop of vaccination rates that have stalled at lower levels than many other industrialized countries where the vaccine is widely available. Experts see a constellation of motives and communities varying from conservatives who see it as a civil liberties issue to religious vaccine skeptics to communities of color distrustful of a historically racist medical establishment.\\nThe US has a long history of mandating vaccines. But previously, vaccinations were required only for government entities or on the state level. This is the first vaccine mandate that extends to so many Americans. However, legal scholars say the mandate falls within the power of federal agencies.\\n“We are at a critical moment,” Jha said. “If we did not really begin to implement these things – if we did not substantially ramp up vaccinations, make testing much more widely available – we’re looking at thousands of people dying every day for weeks and months on end.”\\nIn the past few months, Biden has strengthened his suggestions to get vaccinated, pleading with Americans on Thursday night to “please, do the right thing”.\\nRepublican governors of Arkansas, Mississippi and Tennessee – states with some of the lowest vaccination rates and some of the highest numbers of Covid-19 in the country – have rejected Biden’s calls for mandatory vaccines.\\nThey say vaccines are some of the best tools we have to contain the pandemic, but they stop short at mandating it. Yet other state officials have voiced support.\\nVincent Dixie, a Tennessee state representative, said in an emergency, the government’s job was to step in to ensure the health of its people. “We have all gotten vaccines because the government tells us to, starting from when we were babies, where we were first born we had vaccines, to enter into grade school we had vaccines,” he said.\\nObjecting to the government requirements to be vaccinated, he added, “is an unwise argument to settle in”.\\nHowever, America’s deeply polarized politics has been brought fully to the fore in the increasingly heated debate over vaccine mandates.\\nIn Arizona, for example, the reaction was split. The state’s Republican governor vowed to fight the administration’s “dictatorial approach”. But the Democratic mayor of Phoenix, the state capital, said that the move was “the critical action we need to appropriately fight this virus”.\\nSome health leaders wish a more aggressive approach to containing the pandemic had been implemented earlier. Dr Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, said the mandates may have come “too little, too late”.\\nSchools are not included in this mandate, but Biden urged school districts to vaccinate as many people as much as possible. Nationwide, he said, about 90% of school staff have been vaccinated.\\n“There’s much more work to do, but if we implement the things that the president talked about [Thursday], I think we can look forward to a far better fall and winter this year than we had last year,” Jha said.\\n“And we can look forward to a 2022 where we can spend days and even weeks, and not think about the pandemic. It won’t happen naturally. It will happen if we do the kinds of things that we heard about today.”\\nThis article was amended on 13 September 2021.

       "  'Health experts have warned the government that it needs to increase efforts to ensure more young adults are vaccinated against Covid-19 – as a matter of urgency.\\nThey fear the current low take-up of jabs among 18- to 25-year-olds could lead to a pile-up of vaccine campaigns in September, when other groups are scheduled to get booster injections and also to be inoculated against influenza. In addition, they argue that vaccines also have a crucial role to play in protecting young adults against long Covid, which is now recognised as a serious problem associated with the disease.\\nAt present, less than 60% of young people have been given a first dose of vaccine and, because they will then have to wait for eight weeks for a second dose, newly inoculated individuals will only be ready for their second jab in September, when a booster campaign of third jabs for older people may be launched, along with the flu programme.\\n‘Their childhood has been stolen’: calls for action to tackle long Covid\\nRead more\\n“The issue of vaccine take-up with young adults is a real concern. We need to get higher uptake in the 18- to 25-year-old age group to give us the high levels of immunity that we need as we move into autumn and winter,” said Doug Brown, chief executive of the British Society for Immunology.\\n“The government needs to redouble efforts to engage younger people,” he added. “And they need to do that in ways that are more likely to influence them – for example, by using social media.”\\nIn September, the government wants 35 million flu vaccines delivered, plus second doses for under 30s, jabs for vulnerable 12- to 15-year-olds, as well as the potential booster campaign and a pledge not to leave behind any unvaccinated person who changes their mind.\\nChris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, said: “Given the current take-up rate, vaccinating the under-30s is going to take us longer than hoped. If people haven’t had their first dose by now, their second will be scheduled for September.\\n“The slower it takes to get through those cohorts, the more clash we will have with the other vaccine tasks and there will be a larger challenge for the NHS, because the service will need to deliver five different vaccine tasks at the same time. If you add all that together, it’s a highly complex [operation].”\\nProfessor Anthony Harnden, deputy chair of the Joint Committee of Vaccination and Immunisation, said the booster campaign would be an important insurance policy for vulnerable people, in case their immunity began to fade. “We want to give a boost to those vulnerable groups, starting in September, because we know the older groups are much more at risk, and they had the vaccine a considerable time ago.”\\nAt present, less than 60% of young people have been given a first dose of vaccine. Photograph: Jacob King/PA\\nThe committee has given an interim recommendation for a booster campaign to allow the NHS to plan one.\\nAnother focus for concern is the issue of antibody levels. These are known to decline months after a second jab is given but it is not yet clear if this is associated with a loss of vaccine effectiveness. Other parts of the immune system – memory B cells and T cells – could still be operating fully, maintaining effectiveness.\\n“For many of the vaccines that we’ve used, historically, we haven’t needed boosters, because the virus continues to circulate, and we get boosted naturally. We don’t know if that’s happening,” said Professor Eleanor Riley of Edinburgh University.\\nShe added that it was not clear whether a booster campaign would be needed. “I’m not sure that we have enough data yet to say that we actually need to do boosters. We don’t know if we need them.\\n“Giving them is going to be expensive and time-consuming. But it might be better than taking the risk of not giving them.”',\n",

It’s not an issue in the ACT. I understand it might be in other jurisdictions and they might pursue it.”\\nBarr said the other possible justification was to “give vaccinated people freedom before others” but the ACT would not do so, arguing by the time it reached the 80% fully vaccinated mark it would take less than a week to offer those who had first doses their second dose.\\nHe said there were “human rights issues” in refusing services to unvaccinated people, and ruled out doing so for public services.\\nBarr said individual businesses might insist on seeing that customers had been vaccinated, but ACT Health would not be enforcing that.\\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\\nSign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\\nIn NSW the government is preparing to require people to have vaccine passports to enter high-risk venues including stadiums, theatres and pubs.\\nOn Thursday the premier, Gladys Berejiklian, said that vaccine passports would combine with the QR code system making it easier to “police venues” such as retail outlets and hospitality venues.\\n“If you want to go and buy something which is regarded as a non-essential shop, you will put up the QR code and if it is not a green light saying you have been vaccinated, you won’t be welcome inside,” she told reporters in Sydney.\\n“We are giving venues plenty of notice and businesses plenty of notice, they can prepare for what that looks like.”\\nQuick Guide\\nHow to get the latest news from Guardian Australia\\nShow\\nOn Thursday the Victorian health minister, Martin Foley, acknowledged that the promise of international travel and re-engaging in “commercial, social and cultural life” were encouraging vaccination.\\n“The critical role for government is having systems in place firstly to get as many vaccinated as possible and then to have those foolproof and fair systems that can demonstrate who is and isn’t vaccinated,” he told reporters in Melbourne.\\nNSW Covid reopening plan: roadmap allows some freedoms for fully vaccinated, including visiting pubs and sport venues\\nRead more\\nFoley suggested the state would soon have “a vaccinated economy, a vaccinated cultural life, a vaccinated world operating for those who can demonstrate they are fully and safely vaccinated”.\\nThe Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, declined to say whether vaccine certificates would be needed in future.\\n“At the moment we don’t have Delta in our community so anyone can go along and see [a major event],” she said.\\nPalaszczuk said the issue would be discussed further at national cabinet and the Queensland government was still working through the technological issue of how the check-in app could show vaccination status.',\n",

The proportion of unsure people feel slightly from 9.8% to 8.6% in the same period.\\nThe survey is conducted every two weeks, and each survey wave includes responses from 1,200 people aged 18 years and over.

And they’ll need to be tailored based on a solid understanding of why people aren’t vaccinating and what they need to support their decision-making.”\\nThat was where trained professionals skilled at interviewing people about their vaccine concerns, and home-visits from these health workers to those unsure about vaccines , would prove essential, she said. Language such as calling those people “selfish” or “traitors” might feel therapeutic but would not help change their views.\\n“I’m quite concerned about these people who will choose to remain unvaccinated because life will be harder for them.”\\nLeask said it might be justifiable to require mandatory vaccination among health care staff to protect elderly or vulnerable people, or for remote Aboriginal communities to require proof of full vaccination before allowing visitors.\\n“But there are situations where the risks are not as high and less restrictive options, such as requiring unvaccinated people to get tested and then allowing them to travel if they show a negative test, might be available instead of banning them altogether.\\nMelbourne clinic offers ivermectin despite it not being approved as a Covid treatment\\nRead more\\n“The evidence shows that if you require something inconvenient, such as producing a negative test, which is inconvenient to get, that can actually produce quite high vaccination rates in and of itself. People get sick of it after a while and it’s easier to get vaccinated.”\\nLeask said she was already receiving emails from people saying they would quit their job if their employer required them to vaccinate, and she feared what unemployment would mean for them and their families.\\n“There are people like this in the workforce, and governments and employers also need to think about planning for the loss of those people.”\\nBut Leask was confident Australia could aim high with its Covid-19 vaccination coverage and reach up to 90% vaccination.\\n“We won’t see it until next year if we do reach that level,” she said. “But to reach those high goals we need to look to the evidence for what works to reach people. And over time we should be prepared that the remaining group of unvaccinated will be harder to reach or more reluctant.\\n“These hardcore vaccine refusers will always think Covid is not severe, or not around, or it’s being misdiagnosed, or it’s a conspiracy to make people vaccinate. That’s why you can’t have conversations with them because you don’t even share the same fundamental assumptions about what’s happening.”\\nWhile this group might be small enough that overall vaccination coverage could still reach high levels, Leask said, this would only be the case if those for whom access to vaccines were an issue, or who were on the fence about vaccination, were well-targeted.\\nShe said it was becoming clear that incentives such as entry into lotteries as a reward for vaccinating, as trialled in US states like Ohio, did not work when it came to significantly boosting vaccination rates in this group of people in particular.\\nThe Delta Covid variant and children: transmission in kids is low and only 2% hospitalised, report finds\\nRead more\\n“Incentives don’t overcome barriers to access of vaccines in remote areas,” Leask said. “They don’t overcome difficulties with booking appointments through complex online systems, they don’t overcome the need for a Medicare card when you make an appointment, or overcome concerns about vaccination safety.”\\nProf Anthony Scott, a health economist with the Melbourne Institute who leads the Vaccine Hesitancy Tracker, said researchers periodically asked people about their reasons for hesitancy or refusal as part of the survey.\\n“We have found that it is mostly about safety and effectiveness of vaccines and potential side effects that people are most worried about,” he said.\\nHesitancy was coming down as more information was being communicated about vaccine safety, along with the importance of vaccination during outbreaks, Scott said.\\n“Some people who may have been unwilling might have changed to just being unsure as more information has come out,” he said.\\n“When you look at childhood vaccination and those not willing to get kids vaccinated, they are a very hard, immovable group, but I think with Covid we are seeing at the moment more of an ability to change people’s attitudes.”',\n",

After that, the centre of the virus shifted northwards and to areas in Northern Ireland before rising again in London and the south-east. Hotspots have now developed again across the country.\\nEveryday life in the UK has been subject to varying degrees of restriction since March 2020, although national restrictions were relaxed in all four nations of the UK over the summer of 2021.\\nDetails of the English guidance are listed here, Scottish guidance here, Welsh guidance here and Northern Irish here.\\nHow is the disease progressing in the UK?\\nCases in the UK first peaked in early April 2020, before falling in late spring and summer. Numbers started to increase again in the autumn, falling back briefly in November before reaching a record level in January 2021. Since then cases had declined sharply but have since increased again after the latest lockdown release. They now remain at a high but relatively stable level.

As with hospitalisations, the number of deaths is now at a relatively low level, although there has been an uptick through the summer.\\nHow does the third wave compare to the second wave?\\nSince mid-May 2021, cases shot up at a rate comparable to the start of the second wave in autumn 2020. However, hospitalisations and deaths remain much lower than at the equivalent time during the second wave. Scientists say this is at least partly down to the protective effects of vaccines.\\nWhich variants are dominant?\\nThe Alpha variant appeared in the UK in September 2020 and quickly became the dominant variant. Being more transmissible, it caused a major surge in cases in winter 2020/21. Since May, however, the Delta variant has been the dominant variant through the country.\\nNew variants are concerning because they may be more transmissible or more deadly than the original variant of the Covid-19 virus and vaccines may be less effective against them. Variants are identified by genome-sequencing a sample of positive tests. This process takes time, so numbers below may be up to several weeks behind other metrics like cases.\\nHow is the vaccine rollout progressing?\\nSince UK regulators approved the Pfizer vaccine in December, the UK’s vaccine rollout has picked up pace. Until early July, hundreds of thousands of people were being vaccinated every day, although this has slowed down since.\\nWith vaccines open to over-18s in the UK from 8 June 2021, all adults should be able to get at least a first dose. However, in all age groups there is a persistent number of people who are not vaccinated. The lowest rates of vaccination are among younger age groups. While they were the last to be invited for vaccinations and so haven’t had enough time for a second dose, there are also concerns about vaccine hesitancy among younger people.\\nHow are case rates changing?\\nLockdown had brought down case rates for everyone. But different age groups have been affected differently. Throughout the pandemic working-age people aged between 20 and 60 have had the highest levels of infection.\\nThis has become more stark since the vaccine rollout has protected many of the more vulnerable elderly people in society, with case rates rising among the younger groups at the same time as case rates stay relatively low among older people.\\nFind coronavirus cases near you\\nIn the table below, you can find out the number of cases per 100,000 in your area, both for the last week and since the start of the pandemic.\\nAbout this data\\nThis data comes comes from Public Health England, working with devolved authorities in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.\\nDifferences in data collection and publishing schedules may lead to temporary inconsistencies. 3 and 4 October cases totals include cases from previous days published late owing to a technical fault.\\nThe government figures for deaths that are used in this tracker incorporate any deaths that have occurred within 28 days of a positive test. This means they are able to quickly capture deaths occurring in hospitals and care homes, both settings where testing is widespread.\\nThe ONS, along with its counterparts in Scotland and Northern Ireland, captures deaths data differently. They count all deaths where Covid is on the death certificate. About 90% of these deaths are directly due to Covid while it is a contributory factor in the remaining deaths.\\nDue to the unprecedented and ongoing nature of the coronavirus outbreak, this article is being regularly updated to ensure that it reflects the current situation as well as possible.

North Korea was also slated to receive AstraZeneca shots through Covax, but their delivery has been delayed.\\nAccording to Unicef, North Korea’s health ministry still said it would continue to communicate with Covax over future vaccines.\\nSome experts believe North Korea may want other vaccines, while questioning the effectiveness of Sinovac and the rare blood clots seen in some recipients of the AstraZeneca vaccine.\\nThe previously allocated 1.9m AstraZeneca doses would be enough to vaccinate 950,000 people – only about 7.3% of the North’s 26 million people – meaning North Korea would still need much more quantities of vaccine to inoculate its population.\\n‘We were punch bags’: North Korean prison beatings may be form of torture, says UN\\nRead more\\nLeif-Eric Easley, a professor of international studies at Seoul’s Ewha Womans University, said North Korea was likely angling to receive more effective jabs from Covax and then strategically allocate them domestically.\\n“Pyongyang appears to have issues with Covax involving legal responsibility and distribution reporting requirements. So it might procure vaccines from China to deliver to border regions and soldiers while allocating Covax shots to less sensitive populations,” Easley said.\\n“The Kim regime likely wants the most safe and effective vaccine for the elite, but administering Pfizer would require upgraded cold-chain capability in Pyongyang and at least discreet discussions with the United States. The [Johnson & Johnson] option could also be useful to North Korea given that vaccine’s portability and one-shot regimen,” he said.\\nIn a recent UN report on the North’s human rights situation, the UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, asked North Korea to “take all necessary measures, including through international cooperation and assistance, to provide access to Covid-19 vaccines for all persons, without discrimination”.\\nHe also asked North Korea to form a plan to enable diplomats and aid workers to return to the North and revive humanitarian aid distribution systems as soon as possible in conjunction with its Covid-19 vaccine rollout.\\nAfter their meeting in Seoul last month, Sung Kim, the top US diplomat on North Korea affairs, and his South Korean counterpart, Noh Kyu-duk, told reporters they discussed humanitarian cooperation with North Korea in providing anti-virus resources, sanitation and safe water.',\n",

       "  'Why is there controversy about giving Covid-19 vaccinations to care home staff?\\nMinisters have decreed all care home staff in England must be vaccinated against Covid-19 by 11 November. However, it is estimated – by the government – that about 7% of the 570,000 people employed in English care homes will refuse the vaccine. That represents some 40,000 staff who will no longer be able work in them and care for the elderly.\\nThe union Unison says ministers are leading the country towards a social care disaster and has urged that the “no jab, no job” rule be revoked. For its part, the government says the move is needed to protect the elderly – who are particularly vulnerable to Covid – from being infected by staff. The British Medical Association (BMA) has described the move as “a blunt instrument”.\\nJust how important is it to vaccinate care home staff?\\nThe government says it is vital. Others disagree. Some critics claim that although vaccines are highly effective at preventing admissions to hospital or death, they do not block transmission. Vaccinated care staff could still pass on Covid-19, it is argued. This claim is dismissed by Peter English, past chair of the BMA’s public health medicine committee. “It is not correct to say that ‘we now know vaccination doesn’t prevent transmission.’ On the contrary it does significantly reduce the odds of infection, and if you are not infected you cannot infect others,” he told the Observer.\\nEnglish said vaccination roughly halves the probability of infection and those who are vaccinated are likely to be infectious for a much shorter period. “So the odds of being infected and infecting others are likely well below 50% compared to an unvaccinated person – I would guess they’re of the order of 10% or less. The rationale is therefore straightforward. People who are particularly susceptible to death or severe disease should be protected as much as possible, by vaccination – and by reducing their odds of being exposed to disease.”\\nAre there precedents for imposing vaccinations on staff?\\nSome NHS trusts make it a condition of employment that staff are willing to have the flu vaccine, while doctors and other healthcare workers who have not had a hep B vaccine are not allowed to undertake certain procedures where there is a risk of hepatitis B infection.\\n“Care home staff are not being forced to be vaccinated against Covid-19. All that is being said is that they cannot do a particular job unless they are vaccinated,” says English.',\n",
       "  'As lockdown easing in England is delayed from 21 June to a possible date of 19 July amid concerns of a substantial wave of hospitalisations due to the Delta variant of coronavirus, we take a look at the latest data on the protection offered by vaccines.\\nWhat does vaccine effectiveness mean?\\nVaccine effectiveness refers to how well a vaccine works in the real world. The figures are given with respect to particular outcomes, such as infection, symptomatic disease, hospital admission or death.\\nIf a Covid-19 vaccine is “90% effective” against symptomatic disease it means vaccinated people have a 90% lower risk of developing the illness than those who have not been vaccinated. That means that for 100 unvaccinated people who developed symptomatic Covid, only 10 would have been expected to have fallen ill had they been vaccinated.\\nHowever, it important to note that vaccine effectiveness figures are estimates that lie within a range of possible values.\\nThe Delta variant, first detected in India – which now accounts for more than 90% of new Covid cases in the UK – has raised concerns as it appears to be somewhat more resistant to vaccines than the Alpha variant that was first detected in Kent and previously dominated in the UK.\\nHow effective are the vaccines against the Delta variant compared with the Alpha variant?\\nIn general, Covid jabs are most effective against the most severe outcomes, such as death, and less effective against less severe ones, such as asymptomatic infection.\\nThis appears to be borne out by data collected for the two main Covid jabs in use in the UK against both variants.\\nAccording to figures gathered by Public Health Scotland and published in the Lancet, at least two weeks after the second dose of Covid jabs, protection against infection fell from 92% for the Alpha variant to 79% against the Delta variant for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, while for the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine the protection fell from 73% to 60% respectively.\\nProtection against symptomatic disease has also been found to differ depending on the variant.\\nAccording to the latest figures from Public Health England (PHE), four weeks after one dose, either vaccine offered almost 50% protection against the Alpha variant. However for the Delta variant this protection was lower, with one dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech jab offering about 36% protection against symptomatic disease. For one dose of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine this figure was about 30%.\\nTwo weeks after the second dose, the differences in vaccine effectiveness by variant were more modest, with the Pfizer/BioNTech jab offering 88% protection against symptomatic disease with the Delta variant, compared with 94% protection against the Alpha variant. For the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, the figures were 67% and 74% respectively.\\nPHE has previously noted there may be a number of reasons why the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine has lower figures for either variant, including that it takes longer to reach maximum effectiveness.\\nWhat about hospital admissions?\\nProtection against severe disease is a crucial metric, not least for assessing the potential pressures a new wave of infections could place on health services. The good news is that for this outcome the jabs appear to offer similar protection against both variants.\\nAccording to an analysis by PHE, the Pfizer/BioNTech jab was linked to a 94% vaccine effectiveness against hospital admission with the Delta variant after one dose and 96% after two doses, while the figures for the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab were 71% and 92% respectively.\\nThis protection against hospital admission is similar to that for the Alpha variant, for which the Pfizer figures were 83% and 95% after the first and second jabs respectively, and 76% and 86% respectively for the AstraZeneca jab.\\nWhat about deaths?\\nAt present there is not enough data to say, but the results are expected to be promising. According to PHE: “Further work remains under way to establish the level of protection against mortality from the Delta variant. However, as with other variants, this is expected to be high.”',\n",
       "  'Imposing vaccine passports is likely to make hesitant people even more reluctant to get Covid jabs, research involving more than 16,000 people has found as Downing Street vowed to press ahead with the plan within a month.\\nBoris Johnson announced in July that the government would make it compulsory for nightclubs and other crowded indoor venues to ensure customers have been fully vaccinated before allowing them entry.\\nNo details have yet been published, prompting speculation the plan would be ditched in the face of a backlash from Conservative backbenchers and business groups. But the prime minister’s official spokesperson said on Tuesday there was no change in the policy.\\n“We set out broadly our intention to require vaccination for nightclubs and some other settings. We will be coming forward in the coming weeks with detail for that,” he said.\\nAs well as helping to protect clubbers from the virus, the move is aimed at boosting vaccine uptake – but the research, to be published in the Lancet journal EClinicalMedicine this month, suggests it could be counterproductive among the most hard-to-reach groups.\\nThe survey was carried out in April when most people were either unvaccinated or had received only one dose of a vaccine. It suggested the groups that are less likely to get vaccinated – including the young, non-white ethnicities and non-English speakers – also view vaccine passports less positively.\\n“This creates a risk of creating a divided society wherein the majority are relatively secure but there remain pockets of lower vaccination where outbreaks can still occur,” the authors wrote in the paper, which is currently in preprint form.\\nThe analysis involved 16,527 people, of whom 14,543 had not yet had both vaccine doses. In this group, the vast majority (87.8%) indicated their decision on being jabbed would not be affected by the introduction of passports.\\nHowever, of the remaining 12.2%, about two-thirds suggested they would be less likely to get vaccinated if passports were introduced, while the rest said they would be more inclined. Vaccine passports were viewed less negatively by this group if they were only required for international travel rather than domestic use.\\nThe lead author Dr Alex de Figueiredo from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said these percentages become significant when scaled up to the whole population.\\nYounger age groups, black British ethnicities (compared with white people) and non-English speakers were more likely to express a lower inclination to get vaccinated if passports were introduced. While these groups comprise a relatively small proportion of the UK population, they cluster geographically and tend to be less inclined to get vaccinated in the first place.\\nEvidence that imposing vaccine passports could have the reverse behavioural effect from that intended by ministers will strengthen the hand of Tory backbenchers determined to see off the plan if it comes to a vote in the House of Commons.\\nLabour has also expressed concerns, suggesting a system that included Covid testing as an alternative to vaccination would be a better approach since fully jabbed individuals can still catch and pass on the virus.\\nResearch into the behavioural effects of vaccine passports suggests the scheme triggers social division, said Prof John Drury, a participant in the Sage subcommittee advising on behavioural science, who was speaking in a personal capacity and not involved in the survey.\\n“Not only would vaccine passports create exclusion, that exclusion would be structured by existing inequalities. You only need to look at the data on who isn’t yet vaccinated to understand this – the young, the poor, ethnic minorities stand to be excluded.”\\nThe negative impact of vaccine passports – once the underlying intention to get jabbed was accounted for in the survey – was disproportionately found in males and highly educated people. It’s unclear why that is, said de Figueiredo.\\nThe study echoes historical data that suggests those who are already medically disfranchised will not be made more receptive to jabs by the introduction of more coercive measures, according to Caitjan Gainty, a senior lecturer in the history of science, technology and medicine at King’s College London, who was not involved in the survey study.\\nAnother issue with vaccine passports, especially in light of the highly infectious Delta variant of coronavirus, is their weak scientific basis, scientists say. Someone who is double-jabbed is still half as likely to be infected as someone unvaccinated, notes Paul Hunter, professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia.\\nMany people will have been vaccinated to get their freedoms back, but with high rates of breakthrough infections it’s not impossible that freedoms could be taken away or made conditional on further doses, adds de Figueiredo. “This could be rather problematic as people may tire of this, may start refusing vaccines, and it’s not improbable that this rubs off on other vaccinations.”\\nProposals for vaccine passports have been met with scepticism from Britain’s nightclub sector, which warns it could harm their recovery, while live music industry representatives expressed a preference for the current entry requirement for most venues and festivals – which allows the choice of providing proof of double-vaccination or recovery from Covid or a negative test.\\nVaccine passport schemes introduced abroad have evolved in different directions and triggered varied reactions. In France, tens of thousands protested over a health pass allowing people to access restaurants, bars, planes and trains. The government this week extended the mandate to certain categories of staff.\\nDenmark’s “coronapas” system has been in operation since April but is being dropped from 10 September as authorities believe the virus is no longer a “critical threat” to society. Bars, cafes, restaurants, museums and tattooists have been open for anyone who can show a negative test result less than 72 hours old, or a completed vaccination, using a digital certificate.\\nIsrael, which has been at the forefront of the jabs rollout, has had a “green pass” for much of the year. It released an app in February showing whether people have been fully vaccinated against Covid or have presumed immunity after contracting the disease.\\nA QR code system introduced last year in China categorised people into different colours, with green allowing them to move around freely if QR codes are requested in public spaces for entry.',\n",

And many of the healthcare workers are still not vaccinated.\\n“We cannot move forward together unless we address this imbalance as one. At the same time, families around the world are being overwhelmed by mass-scale misinformation across news media and social media, where those who peddle in lies and fear are creating vaccine hesitancy, which in turn leads to divided communities and eroding trust.\\n“This is a system we need to break if we are to overcome Covid-19 and the risk of new variants.”\\nHe added: “Where you are born should not affect your ability to survive when the drugs and knowhow exist to keep you alive and well.”\\nHarry was presenting the heroes of the year award at the ceremony, held at Tate Modern in London, where the singer Ed Sheeran, actor Regé-Jean Page and the England football manager, Gareth Southgate, were also honoured.\\nThe Line of Duty star Adrian Dunbar was named television actor of the year.

A really important message.”\\nGilbert said: “We’re not going to be safe until everybody is safe and it’s really important to get the vaccine to everybody around the world.”\\nBoth hoped their success would pave the way for more women in science. “I always wanted to be a scientist when I was a schoolgirl, I didn’t see why I wouldn’t be. It’s not always easy to see how that career’s going to pan out but I hope more women will consider it now,” Gilbert told PA Media.\\nGreen added: “And it’s also great fun to do.

The machine works only on AstraZeneca multi-dose vials currently and labels show each vial can provide 10 to 11 doses.\\n“The machine guarantees with accuracy that we can gain an extra 20% from each vaccine vial - from 10 to 12 doses,” said Juthamas Ratanavaraporn, the lead researcher of the team at the university’s Biomedical Engineering Research Center.\\n“The extra 20% that we get means that if we have AstraZeneca for 1 million people, this machine can increase the number of doses to 1.2 million people,” said Juthamas.\\nWhile some health workers using low dead space syringes that aim to reduce wastage can draw up to 12 doses per vial, it requires a high level of skill. “This could drain a lot of the health workers’ energy. They would have to do this every day for many months,” Juthamas said.\\nThailand had kept Covid-19 largely under control for much of the pandemic, but more virulent variants such as Delta have sent the number of cases and deaths soaring since April, ramping up pressure on authorities to increase the pace of vaccinations.\\nSo far, about 9% of Thailand’s population of more than 66 million have been fully vaccinated, with the rollout hindered by lower-than-anticipated vaccine supplies.\\nThe researchers say they should be able to produce 20 more AutoVacc units within three or four months but government funds and support would be needed to expand across the country.\\nThe prototype machine costs 2.5m baht (£55,000), including other materials such as syringes, said Juthamas, adding that while they were open to export opportunities, that was something for the future. They also plan to make similar machines to use with the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines.\\nJuthamas said the machine was aimed at removing burdens on health workers. Thailand has reported about 1.1m Covid-19 infections and 10,085 deaths in total, pushing parts of the health system to the brink.\\n“When the health workers are too tired, there are also chances of human error, so we should let the machines work on this,” she said.',\n",

       "  'M\\nany New Zealanders like to think of their government as a principled actor in international affairs. Discussions of New Zealand’s role in foreign policy in recent years often laud New Zealand’s nuclear-free stance in the 1980s. There is widespread pride in New Zealand’s “independent foreign policy”, including its decision not to go to war in Iraq in 2003.\\nBut the story of New Zealand’s role in the world, historically and today, is much more complex than these cliches would suggest. Documents just released under the Official Information Act provide another example of a murkier world of New Zealand foreign policy decision-making.\\n‘Big questions’: New Zealand Covid minister raises doubts about elimination strategy\\nRead more\\nThey show the ministry of foreign affairs and trade (MFAT) telling the minister of trade’s office in December: “We don’t support the waiver”, in reference to a widely publicised proposal to waive intellectual property rules to share Covid technologies. One of the reasons later given is New Zealand’s “economic interest” in protecting property rights and investments of New Zealand companies, even in the face of widespread civil society support for the move.\\nIn October 2020, with the Covid-19 pandemic raging, India and South Africa had approached the World Trade Organization (WTO) to ask for a waiver of intellectual property rights on technologies needed to deal with the pandemic, including patents on vaccines. This became known as the push for a “people’s vaccine”. The agreement establishing the WTO allows a waiver of ordinary rules in “exceptional circumstances”. A global pandemic – sending countries into lengthy lockdowns, ripping through the global south, killing hundreds of thousands of people in the global north – would seem to fit the bill of those “exceptional circumstances”.\\nEmails released under the Official Information Act show that by December the New Zealand minister of trade’s office appeared to be unaware of New Zealand’s position on the waiver.\\nThe minister of trade’s senior trade adviser asks MFAT officials on 7 December 2020: “… what is our position on the TRIPS waiver?” A senior MFAT official replies the same day: “We don’t support the waiver.” It is not clear what broader discussions informed this position, whether ministers or the cabinet were involved with formulating New Zealand’s position, or whether there was any pushback on MFAT’s statement of New Zealand’s position.\\nThe documents refer to the importance of prioritising commercial concerns for private companies. More specifically, MFAT officials worry relaxing intellectual property rules on Covid technologies might harm New Zealand companies. An MFAT briefing sent on 10 February 2021 to a range of ministers, including the prime minister, underscores that “NZ has economic interest in protecting the property rights and investments of innovative New Zealand health sector companies such as Fisher and Paykel Healthcare”.\\nNew Zealand eventually changed its tune to support the waiver of intellectual property rules – but only after the Biden administration shifted to back the waiver in May. The emails released last month seem to confirm New Zealand changed its position because of the US decision.\\nThe episode sounds alarm bells about decision-making in New Zealand trade and foreign policy. Dialogue on foreign policy is dominated by a privileged few. Despite the efforts of public and civil society groups to engage with the government through op-eds, a petition, a video and an open letter signed by 42 civil society groups, unions and individuals working in relevant fields, the New Zealand foreign affairs ministry appeared to place significant weight on the interests of business.\\nThe correspondence between MFAT and the minister’s office raises the question: who should get to decide New Zealand’s position on key international issues? Who should decide how much weight is placed on the economic interest of New Zealand companies and the health interests of people in New Zealand and around the world, and how are these interests balanced? Are these positions being decided in a democratic way?\\nAnd this is not just a problem of democratic process. These decisions have human consequences. Delay on sharing vaccine technology worldwide, as wealthy countries blocked calls for a people’s vaccine, made it more likely that variants of Covid-19 would emerge. New Zealand is now suffering from the effects of this, with the Delta variant this week being responsible for New Zealand’s first community outbreak of Covid-19 since February.\\nNew Zealand records another 41 Covid cases as it braces for biggest outbreak of pandemic\\nRead more\\nWith foreign policy shielded from public scrutiny in New Zealand, these documents provide a rare glimpse of how decisions on issues of crucial international importance seem to be made between officials and ministers. In this case, it was a decision to relax intellectual property rules for Covid-19 vaccines. But what does this tell us about how NZ will decide its global position on other global existential threats like climate change?\\nWe are already lagging behind other countries on climate action. If our international climate policy is driven by the same narrow-minded focus on commercial interests that clearly informed New Zealand’s foreign policy response to the people’s vaccine, then we need to change direction fast.\\nIf the New Zealand government is truly committed to an independent and Indigenous-based foreign policy, as it has claimed, our foreign affairs and trade ministers cannot leave decisions about foreign policy positioning entirely to MFAT officials. Ministers will need to push back more firmly on advice, including advice that equates companies’ interests with New Zealand’s interests, if this government really wants to forge a new direction for foreign policy.\\nIt’s time for foreign policy decision-making to come out of the shadows.',\n",

       "  \"T\\nHOUGH we can slow the spread of Covid-19, through confinement and other social distancing measures, and scientists are developing drugs to treat its symptoms, the only way to actually prevent people from catching Covid-19 is with a vaccine – and we don’t yet have one of those.\\nNearly 80 companies and academic institutions are racing to produce one, and of those, five are already testing their vaccine candidates in people. The first of these to enter human trials – one produced by Boston-based biotech company Moderna – did so on 16 March.\\nThis unprecedented speed is thanks in large part to early Chinese efforts to sequence the genetic material of Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. China shared that sequence in early January, allowing research groups around the world to grow the live virus and study how it invades human cells and makes people sick.\\nCoronavirus vaccine: when will we have one?\\nRead more\\nBut there is another reason for the head start. Though nobody could have predicted that the next infectious disease to threaten the globe would be caused by a coronavirus – flu is generally considered to pose the greatest pandemic risk – vaccinologists had hedged their bets by working on “prototype” pathogens. “The speed with which we have [produced these candidates] builds very much on the investment in understanding how to develop vaccines for other coronaviruses,” says Richard Hatchett, CEO of the Oslo-based nonprofit the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi), which is leading efforts to finance and coordinate Covid-19 vaccine development.\\nHere's how your body gains immunity to coronavirus\\nZania Stamataki\\nRead more\\nCoronaviruses have caused two other recent epidemics – severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) in China in 2002-04, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers), which started in Saudi Arabia in 2012. In both cases, work began on vaccines that were later shelved when the outbreaks were contained. One company, Maryland-based Novavax, has now repurposed those vaccines for Sars-CoV-2, and says it has several candidates ready to enter human trials this spring. Moderna, meanwhile, built on earlier work on the Mers virus conducted at the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Maryland.\\nSARS-CoV-2 shares between 80% and 90% of its genetic material with the virus that caused SARS – hence its name. Both consist of a strip of RNA enclosed in a fatty shell through which protrude many protein spikes. The spikes lock on to receptors on the surface of cells lining the human lung – the same type of receptor in both cases – allowing the virus to break into the cell. Once inside, it hijacks the cell’s reproductive machinery to produce more copies of itself, before breaking out of the cell again and killing it in the process.\\nAll vaccines work according to the same basic principle. They present part or all of the pathogen to the human immune system, usually in the form of an injection and at a low dose, to prompt the system to produce antibodies to the pathogen. Antibodies are a kind of immune memory which, having been elicited once, can be quickly mobilised again if the person is exposed to the virus in its natural form.\\nLike most vaccinologists, I don’t think this vaccine will be ready before 18 months\\nProfessor Annelies Wilder-Smith\\nTraditionally, immunisation has been achieved using live, weakened forms of the virus, or part or whole of the virus once it has been inactivated by heat or chemicals. These methods have drawbacks. The live form can continue to evolve in the host, for example, potentially recapturing some of its virulence and making the recipient sick, while higher or repeat doses of the inactivated virus are required to achieve the necessary degree of protection. Some of the Covid-19 vaccine projects are using these tried-and-tested approaches, but others are using newer technology. One more recent strategy – the one that Novavax is taking, for example – constructs a “recombinant” vaccine. This involves extracting the genetic code for the protein spike on the surface of SARS-CoV-2, which is the part of the virus most likely to provoke an immune reaction in humans, and pasting it into the genome of a bacterium or yeast – forcing these micro-organisms to churn out large quantities of the protein. Other approaches, that are even newer, bypass the protein and build vaccines from the genetic instruction itself. This is the case for Moderna and a German company, CureVac, both of which are building Covid-19 vaccines out of messenger RNA.\\nCepi’s original portfolio of four funded Covid-19 vaccine projects was heavily skewed towards these more innovative technologies, but it has since added four others that take more tried-and-tested approaches – including a project at the University of Oxford that uses a harmless, non-replicating virus to carry SARS-CoV-2 genetic material into the body’s cells – and it will continue to add to that portfolio. “Our experience with vaccine development is that you can’t anticipate where you’re going to stumble,” says Hatchett, meaning that diversity is key. And the stage where any approach is most likely to stumble is clinical or human trials.\\nClinical trials, an essential precursor to regulatory approval, usually take place in three phases. The first, involving a few dozen healthy volunteers, tests the vaccine for safety, monitoring for adverse effects. The second, involving several hundred people, usually in a part of the world affected by the disease, looks at how effective the vaccine is, and the third does the same in several thousand people. But there’s a high level of attrition as experimental vaccines pass through these phases. “Not all horses that leave the starting gate will finish the race,” says Bruce Gellin, who runs the global immunisation programme for the Washington DC-based non-profit, the Sabin Vaccine Institute.\\nThere are good reasons for that. Either the candidates are unsafe, or they’re ineffective, or both. Screening out duds is essential, which is why clinical trials can’t be skipped or hurried. Approval can be accelerated if regulators have approved similar products before. The annual flu vaccine, for example, is the product of a well-honed assembly line in which only one or a few modules have to be updated each year. In contrast, Sars-CoV-2 is a novel pathogen in humans, and many of the technologies being used to build vaccines are relatively untested too. No vaccine made from genetic material – RNA or DNA – has been approved to date, for example. So many of the Covid-19 vaccine candidates have to be treated as brand new vaccines, and as Gellin says: “While there is a push to do things as fast as possible, it’s really important not to take shortcuts.”\\nAn illustration of that is a vaccine that was produced in the 1960s against respiratory syncytial virus, a common virus that causes cold-like symptoms in children. In clinical trials, this vaccine was found to aggravate those symptoms in infants who went on to catch the virus. A similar effect was observed in animals given an early experimental Sars vaccine. It was later modified to eliminate that problem but, now that it has been repurposed for Sars-CoV-2, it will need to be put through especially stringent safety testing to rule out the risk of enhanced disease.\\nIt’s for these reasons that taking a vaccine candidate all the way to regulatory approval typically takes a decade or more, and why President Trump sowed confusion when, at a meeting at the White House on 2 March, he pressed for a vaccine to be ready by the US elections in November – an impossible deadline. “Like most vaccinologists, I don’t think this vaccine will be ready before 18 months,” says Annelies Wilder-Smith, professor of emerging infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. That’s already extremely fast, and it assumes there will be no hitches.\\nIn the meantime, there is another potential problem. As soon as a vaccine is approved, it’s going to be needed in vast quantities – and many of the organisations in the Covid-19 vaccine race simply don’t have the necessary production capacity. Vaccine development is already a risky affair, in business terms, because so few candidates get anywhere near the clinic. Production facilities tend to be tailored to specific vaccines, and scaling these up when you don’t yet know if your product will succeed is not commercially feasible. Cepi and similar organisations exist to shoulder some of the risk, keeping companies incentivised to develop much-needed vaccines. Cepi plans to invest in developing a Covid-19 vaccine and boosting manufacturing capacity in parallel, and last month it put out a call for $2bn to allow it to do so.\\n05:59\\nCan you get coronavirus twice? – video explainer\\nOnce a Covid-19 vaccine has been approved, a further set of challenges will present itself. “Getting a vaccine that’s proven to be safe and effective in humans takes one at best about a third of the way to what’s needed for a global immunisation programme,” says global health expert Jonathan Quick of Duke University in North Carolina, author of The End of Epidemics (2018). “Virus biology and vaccines technology could be the limiting factors, but politics and economics are far more likely to be the barrier to immunisation.”\\nThe problem is making sure the vaccine gets to all those who need it. This is a challenge even within countries, and some have worked out guidelines. In the scenario of a flu pandemic, for example, the UK would prioritise vaccinating healthcare and social care workers, along with those considered at highest medical risk – including children and pregnant women – with the overall goal of keeping sickness and death ra tes as low as possible. But in a pandemic, countries also have to compete with each other for medicines.\\nLockdowns can't end until Covid-19 vaccine found, study says\\nRead more\\nBecause pandemics tend to hit hardest those countries that have the most fragile and underfunded healthcare systems, there is an inherent imbalance between need and purchasing power when it comes to vaccines. During the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic, for example, vaccine supplies were snapped up by nations that could afford them, leaving poorer ones short. But you could also imagine a scenario where, say, India – a major supplier of vaccines to the developing world – not unreasonably decides to use its vaccine production to protect its own 1.3 billion-strong population first, before exporting any.\\nOutside of pandemics, the WHO brings governments, charitable foundations and vaccine-makers together to agree an equitable global distribution strategy, and organisations like Gavi, the vaccine alliance, have come up with innovative funding mechanisms to raise money on the markets for ensuring supply to poorer countries. But each pandemic is different, and no country is bound by any arrangement the WHO proposes – leaving many unknowns. As Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, points out: “The question is, what will happen in a situation where you’ve got national emergencies going on?”\\nThis question is being debated, but it will be a while before we see how it plays out. “[This pandemic] will probably have peaked and declined before a vaccine is available,” says Wilder-Smith. A vaccine could still save many lives, especially if the virus becomes endemic or perennially circulating – like flu – and there are further, possibly seasonal, outbreaks. But until then, our best hope is to slow the spread of the disease as far as possible. So to repeat the sage advice: stay home, wash your hands.\",\n",

       "  'A\\nMailOnline headline on 13 June read: “Study shows 29% of the 42 people who have died after catching the new strain had BOTH vaccinations.” In Public Health England’s technical briefing on 25 June, that figure had risen to 43% (50 of 117), with the majority (60%) having received at least one dose.\\nIt could sound worrying that the majority of people dying in England with the now-dominant Delta (B.1.617.2) variant have been vaccinated. Does this mean the vaccines are ineffective? Far from it, it’s what we would expect from an effective but imperfect vaccine, a risk profile that varies hugely by age and the way the vaccines have been rolled out.\\nConsider the hypothetical world where absolutely everyone had received a less than perfect vaccine. Although the death rate would be low, everyone who died would have been fully vaccinated.\\nThe vaccines are not perfect. PHE estimates two-dose effectiveness against hospital admission with the Delta infections at around 94%. We can perhaps assume there is at least 95% protection against Covid-19 death, which means the lethal risk is reduced to less than a twentieth of its usual value.\\nBut the risk of dying from Covid-19 is extraordinarily dependent on age: it halves for each six to seven year age gap. This means that someone aged 80 who is fully vaccinated essentially takes on the risk of an unvaccinated person of around 50 – much lower, but still not nothing, and so we can expect some deaths.\\nThe PHE report also reveals that nearly a third of deaths from the Delta variant are of unvaccinated people over 50, which may be surprising given high vaccine coverage; for example, OpenSAFELY estimates more than 93% among the 65-69s. But there are lower rates in deprived areas and some ethnicities and communities with limited coverage will continue to experience more than their fair share of loss.\\nCoverage and effectiveness are important numbers for assessing vaccination programmes. It is better to look at cool analysis by analysts, rather than hot takes on social and other media.\\nDavid Spiegelhalter is chair of the Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication at Cambridge.

       "  'In December 2019, hospitals in Wuhan, China, reported that they were dealing with dozens of cases of pneumonia of an unknown cause. They soon identified the disease as being caused by a novel coronavirus.\\nTeresa Lambe, associate professor, Jenner Institute My brother lived in China, so whenever there was an emerging or break pathogen there, I used to follow it. I remember thinking very early on that this was probably another influenza strain.\\nSarah Gilbert, Saïd professor of vaccinology, Jenner Institute [Before Covid] I was developing vaccines against a range of emerging pathogens, specifically Mers, Nipah and Lassa [virus]. We also had applied for funding to work on preparedness for “disease X” – the unknown pathogen that is coming. But it wasn’t funded, so we didn’t manage to put any of those plans in place.\\nAndrew Pollard, director, Oxford Vaccine Group None of us thought that this was about to be a pandemic.\\nOn 11 January 2020, media reported the first death from what would come to be known as Sars-CoV-2, or Covid-19. The same day, Chinese virologist Zhang Yongzhen published the genome sequence of the virus online. Lambe received the genome in her email inbox early Saturday morning.\\nLambe We knew it was coming, and we’d already had a discussion about what to do. We designed [the vaccine] over that weekend.\\nSarah Gilbert: ‘We’re not a big corporation.’ Photograph: Manuel Vázquez/The Guardian\\nGilbert We knew before the genome came that it was a new coronavirus, not the original Sars, not Mers or any of the seasonal human coronaviruses. But because it was a coronavirus, we knew the part of the genome we needed was the part that encodes the spike protein on the surface. That’s what you want to raise an antibody response against.\\nCath Green, head of the clinical biomanufacturing facility Sarah [Gilbert] had already made a vaccine against Mers, so she knew what the vaccine against the new coronavirus was going to look like. They take the DNA sequence of the coronavirus spike protein from the Chinese lab and adapt that to make it the right fit to go into our system. The Jenner lab take that sequence and insert it into a bigger sequence which contains the adenovirus genome. So I received from them a really small tube with a few micrograms of DNA. My job was to make that into the vaccine.\\nGilbert It was potentially just a demonstration project at that stage.\\nOn 30 January 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a “health emergency of international concern”. By that point, the virus had spread to several countries, including Japan, Taiwan and the US, which closed its borders to Chinese travellers. The same day, the first case was confirmed in the UK.\\nPollard Knowing the scale of what we were facing – vaccines normally take 10 to 15 years to produce – was concerning. We had to try to think how we were going to change that into something where we could make an impact before the pandemic could kill millions of people.\\nIn mid-February, Gilbert’s group at the Jenner and Pollard’s Oxford Vaccine Group joined forces to focus their efforts on developing their vaccine candidate. By then, cases were spreading rapidly worldwide.\\n\\nPollard We realised that to do something fast and at scale, we all had to come together.\\nFederica Cappuccini, senior postdoctoral scientist There were emails going around, like, what’s your availability? What skills do you have? What can you do [to help]?\\nHannah Robinson, clinical delivery lead I remember when we had that first meeting, one of the scientists was saying that every day we’re not getting a vaccine out there, that’s 10,000 people dying.\\nGreen and her colleagues inserted the DNA – containing the instructions to make the spike protein – into a culture of genetically modified human kidney cells.\\nGreen We have to take the DNA and insert it into the human cells in a very controlled environment. And then we have to identify a clone – a cell that is starting to make the vaccine, but doing that from one single copy of the DNA we’ve inserted. The vaccine is a virus, so it’s multiplying in the cell; eventually the cell pops, the virus is released, and it can then infect the surrounding cells. One virus fills up a cell, that pops, goes up to 100 cells, they pop, fill up 1,000 cells, and so it goes exponentially. Although we started with one virus particle, I think we ended up with 300ml of a solution containing the vaccine. Every single dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine that’s in somebody’s arm today originated with our first clone. D8, it was called.\\nTo test the vaccine’s safety, and its ability to induce an immune response, it was administered concurrently to animal subjects: to mice and pigs at the Pirbright Institute in Surrey, and rhesus macaques, at Rocky Mountain Labs in Montana in the US. Meanwhile, the Oxford scientists raced ahead with planning a phase 1 clinical trial.\\nPollard Normally you might get into studies in mice, look at the data from those, then you might go into non-human primates, but that’s several years gone by. If you get good results, you go and find someone to fund you to do the manufacturing, which might take 18 months, then you start the phase 1 trial. We realised that you have to overlap all those processes. So the animal studies started in February, and by the time we got to March, the manufacturing was under way for human trials – and we didn’t even have any data from the animal studies yet.\\nAndrew Pollard: ‘We need to be ready for new variants.’ Photograph: Manuel Vázquez/The Guardian\\nRobinson You’ve got to do submissions to ethics committees and the MHRA [Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, which approves the use of vaccines in the UK] – all the documents that are used to run a trial. They need to be written and reviewed, then submitted, which in a pre-pandemic process would take maybe six months.\\nPollard The MHRA made this the priority, so they put more people on it. Everything was sent in; seven days later they were able to give approval.\\nOn 23 March 2020, with cases hitting 6,650 a day in the UK, Boris Johnson announced the UK would enter the first lockdown. Non-essential businesses were closed; all non-essential workers were ordered to stay at home to prevent spreading the virus. The same day, the government awarded a £2.2m grant to fund the Oxford team’s research.\\nMaheshi Ramasamy, senior clinical researcher I’m a consultant trained in infectious diseases and my day job is looking after people in the hospital. The first time we saw cases here in Oxford was just after that February half-term. We started to see one or two, and admitted them as a precaution. Then, around mid-March, I turned up on Monday on the ward. On the Friday we’d had one person with Covid; now there were 11. They were much older, they were very frail, and they were dying.\\nLambe I remember the walk from my house being so quiet, not having to look before crossing the road because there were no cars. It was eerie.\\nGreen Everything ground to a halt. We were struggling to get masks, disinfectant. But because we’ve got a lab here, and hand sanitiser is effectively just ethanol, a bit of hydrogen peroxide and some glycerol, we made a few litres and splashed that around.\\nResearchers working in the Jenner Institute. Photograph: Manuel Vázquez/The Guardian\\nPollard There was no PPE available within the NHS. We needed thermometers for our volunteers; there were none anywhere in Europe.\\nGilbert I remember a conversation with Matt Hancock, him saying, “What do you need?” I said, “PPE.”\\nRamasamy That was a really miserable time to be working in hospital. We were all terrified of this new disease that we’d never seen before. We didn’t know how to manage it. There was one moment when somebody said to me, “Is this what the end of the world feels like?”\\nBy early April, as the daily death toll in the UK topped 1,000 for the first time and the prime minister was put in intensive care, the first batch of the vaccine was nearly ready to begin the phase 1 clinical trial.\\nGreen There’s a stage where you have to centrifuge the material through a gradient, and all of the vaccine lines up in one layer. You can see it. Kathy, one of my production team, came out and said: “Look at these babies!” We were like, “Oh my God!” That was the day when we knew we had enough, and we could get it into somebody’s arm in three weeks’ time. That was great. I will remember that always.\\nPollard We had by then already got ethical approval, and the vaccine had been made. So the day after the [successful] results from the animal trials were available, we gave the first dose.\\nOn 23 April, the first dose of the Oxford vaccine, then known as ChAdOx1, was administered to Elisa Granato, a microbiologist. Within 48 hours, fake news websites began to spread a rumour that Granato had died from side-effects of the vaccine.\\nPollard She hadn’t, of course.\\nGilbert Her relatives had to be kept informed, because her family and friends were hearing that she’d died.\\nPollard The BBC did an interview that Sunday morning with Elisa and they were able to demonstrate that she was alive. In that case, the media in the UK saved the day. Despite that, some of those fake news stories have really damaged confidence in vaccines.\\nLambe I don’t think I appreciated how much we needed to communicate with the public until we were almost halfway through.\\nTeresa Lambe: ‘I remember thinking this was probably another influenza strain.’ Photograph: Manuel Vázquez/The Guardian\\nGilbert What I’m trying to do more recently is let people know that, you know, we’re not some other type of being. We’re not a big corporation, we’re not evil big pharma. But we work with big pharma, because big pharma have a useful job to do.\\nLambe And they’re not evil! They’re really nice people.\\nOn 30 April, Oxford University signed a deal with the British-Swedish pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca to mass-produce the vaccine. Crucially, the company agreed to Oxford’s demand that it provide the vaccine for no profit to developing countries during the pandemic.\\nGilbert We weren’t involved in those discussions. It was other people within the university. We were frankly flat out with what we were doing at that time.\\nLambe But it was an absolute for everybody in the team.\\nPollard We wanted to have a vaccine that could be distributed globally so you need a big pharmaceutical company to do that. AstraZeneca fit the bill. The most extraordinary thing about them is they were prepared to do that not-for-profit. It’s almost unthinkable that a business would think that was a reasonable thing to do.\\nWith phase 1 trials demonstrating a successful antibody response and no severe side-effects, plans were put in place to commence a phase 2 and phase 3 trial simultaneously in the UK and South Africa, and later Brazil and the US. Meanwhile, the US, UK and other governments signed deals with AstraZeneca to purchase tens of millions of doses. Rival companies Pfizer and Moderna had also begun clinical trials.\\nPollard The first lockdown was having the most incredible impact on suppressing the virus. By the time the trials actually started, it was clear that there weren’t going to be enough cases. So for our phase 2 and 3 trials, which were already being planned through April, there were two bits of thinking. One was: we have no idea what the next wave will look like, so we ought to be geographically dispersed. It could be the next big wave was in the UK, or it might be that we needed to be in South Africa or Brazil. The other was to make sure we wouldn’t find the people in Africa or South Asia or Latin America saying, “Well, this vaccine has only been tested in Europe.” So that was the rationale for being in each of those countries.\\nThroughout the trial, supply of the vaccine was limited, which led to extraordinary measures.\\nRobinson I remember being on the call with Andy [Pollard] on a Sunday with the Italian manufacturers, and we decided that we would have to charter a plane and get the vaccine to the UK, so our UK team could label it, so it would be available the following day for us to run the clinic.\\nIt emerged that, due to a technical complication, the vaccine doses manufactured in Italy were of a different concentration from those Green’s lab had produced in Oxford.\\nGilbert We have to measure the concentration of the vaccine and there are different ways of doing it. Advent [the Italian manufacturer] use one assay [test] and we use another one. When we got the batch from Italy, we discovered we were getting different results from the two assays. One of them was giving us a result twice as high as the other. So we had to decide which concentration to use to continue with the clinical trials. If we had chosen one, there was a risk we could be giving half the dose, and if we chose the other, there was a risk we could be giving twice the dose. So we went with the safe option, which was to give the one where if we were wrong, we’d be giving half a dose.\\nPollard We went back to the MHRA and they agreed we should adjust the dose. Then we continued with the trial. And I think that huge flexibility – the regulator allowing us to adjust that – actually saved an enormous number of lives.\\nBy the summer, as the world waited for news of a potential vaccine, the Jenner Institute became the target of unprecedented attention from world media, but also anti-vaccine protests, cyber attacks and even thieves.\\nCharles Parkins, facilities manager, Old Road Campus We did have demonstrations outside, a guy and his supporters making a lot of noise and allegations. We had a few of those; they were dealt with by university security and police. But the person who shut the loudmouth up was one of the builders working on the site. After that, he lost his voice.\\nOto Velicka, senior buildings and facilities manager We had a lot of cyber attacks and threatening emails, tweets on our feeds and social platforms, and phone calls, which we had to get the police involved in.\\nCharles Parkins: ‘We had people protesting outside.’ Photograph: Manuel Vázquez/The Guardian\\nParkins One thief got into the building. He rummaged through offices, found a couple of brand new computers, put them in his backpack and left. The strange thing is, two or three days later, another chap banged on the front door saying, “I want to come in.” I said, “You’re not coming in.” He dropped a plastic bag by the door. I called security, thinking it could be a bomb or anything. They came across and said, “Charles, it’s four brand new computers.” I don’t know what the connection was between the two guys, but we ended up with our computers back.\\nOn 9 November 2020, the world rejoiced as Pfizer/BioNTech announced their vaccine was 90% effective. On 16 November, Moderna announced its vaccine showed 94.5% efficacy. A few days later, Oxford had amassed enough data to release initial results on the efficacy of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine. Overall, the data showed its vaccine was 70% effective at preventing Covid-19. Confusingly, the data showed that for those given two full doses, efficacy was just 62% – but a smaller group given the half-dose, followed by a full dose, saw 90% effectiveness.\\nCappuccini Because Pfizer and Moderna released their efficacy data before us, that window – which wasn’t really a long time – felt like ages.\\nPollard I was sitting here and the data safety monitoring board members went through the data with me. I was exhausted as we’d been working so hard to get everything ready. It was quite a surreal moment because no one else in the team was here. It was just me on my own seeing the data for the first time. I phoned Sarah Gilbert and told her the results.\\nGilbert I got a call on Saturday evening from Andy Pollard, which surprised me, because he’d told me not to expect any results until Sunday. I was saying, “Why can’t you just tell me the result?” Because I was expecting a number, x% – but it was more complicated than that, as we all now know. But it was effective, and that was great.\\nPollard The exhaustion meant that the emotion was perhaps less than there might have been.\\nMustapha Bittaye: ‘Every effort, every sleepless night, have all paid off.’ Photograph: Manuel Vázquez/The Guardian\\nMustapha Bittaye, postdoctoral researcher I knew the vaccine was going to be used across the globe. My family back in the Gambia are going to benefit from this vaccine. So when I heard about the efficacy results, I was so happy. It brought a sense that every effort, every sleepless night, the long hours, have all paid off.\\nCappuccini Because these vaccines are going to go in the arms of the people we love as well.\\nOn 23 November, AstraZeneca released its findings. The complexity of the results led to criticism in the scientific community, who were unhappy that the company had communicated the results by press release, without making the underlying data immediately available.\\nGilbert There is a legal requirement, with AstraZeneca involved: if they have any data that might affect their stock price, it has to be communicated immediately before the markets open. Our preference is absolutely not to release data by press release; we want the peer-reviewed publication. But that had to happen.\\nRamasamy The low dose thing was a bit of a red herring. When we went back and looked at the data, it was actually the interval between doses that was important. So the longer the gap between the first and the second dose – when you go from four weeks to 12 weeks – you get better immune responses.\\nOn 30 December 2020, the MHRA approved the vaccine for rollout in the UK. In January, in the midst of the second wave, hundreds of thousands of doses were administered to at-risk groups in the UK. However, because of manufacturing problems, supplies to the EU were delayed, triggering a political crisis. To make matters worse, French president Emmanuel Macron claimed the vaccine was “quasi-ineffective” in those over 65 – seemingly based on a lack of data in older age groups.\\nPollard There were two reasons why we didn’t have enough cases in that older age group. One was because in all countries, older adults were more conservative in the pandemic, so they were less exposed to the virus. The second reason is that there was nothing known about the vaccines, and our data safety monitoring board said, “We are a bit more worried about older adults, so we think you should do them sequentially. Look at the safety and get the immune response data before you start your efficacy arm in that older age group.” So by the time the interim analysis in November came, we hadn’t had much time to accrue data in older adults.\\nThe Old Road Campus research building. Photograph: Manuel Vázquez/The Guardian\\nGilbert We’re not involved with [the politics] at all, because that is AstraZeneca. We’re watching the news like everybody, but there’s nothing we can do about it. AstraZeneca had made very large efforts to get manufacturing established. But these aren’t small molecule drugs; these are not very straightforward things to manufacture. Nobody’s done this at this scale before, let alone at this speed, so you can’t predict how long it’s going to take.\\nPollard I don’t think [supply] could have been any better than it is today, given how hard it is to make vaccines.\\nLambe Still more than 90% of the Covax doses are AstraZeneca. And that to me is a big deal.\\nGilbert Our aim from the very beginning has been to make a vaccine for the world, not financial profit. As there are still not enough doses of licensed Covid vaccines for everyone in the world, we need to make sure political decisions don’t result in any of those doses going to waste.\\nReports began to emerge linking the AstraZeneca vaccine to rare blood clots, as well as low platelet counts, in a very small number of recipients. (The Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which also uses an adenovirus vector, has also been linked to similar cases.) It is now thought that blood clots may affect about one in 100,000 patients. In response, many countries have decided not to administer the vaccine to lower age groups. Fear of blood clots is also contributing to low uptake in poorer countries.\\nRamasamy All drugs have side-effects. We were looking out for it within the clinical trials, monitoring every time a participant had any kind of serious medical event. As a clinician, it’s always devastating when you hear about severe side-effects.\\nMaheshi Ramasamy: ‘It was the interval between doses that was important.’ Photograph: Manuel Vázquez/The Guardian\\nGilbert It’s difficult because different vaccines were being used in different age groups in different countries. At one point, Europe was saying that it was a phenomenon happening to women, not to men. That’s not actually true – it was just that the vaccine was mainly being given to young healthcare workers, the majority of whom are women. We still don’t understand it. People have come up with a number of hypotheses, and we’re investigating them. It may take quite a long time to fully understand, because it is so rare.\\nPollard Over the course of the last year, about 1,800 people out of every million have died with Covid. And when we look at the death rate among the vaccinated people from their side-effects, it’s about two per million. So it’s absolutely clear from an overall risk-benefit perspective that we should be vaccinating people.\\nParvinder Aley, director of operations If you would take any other regulated drug and accept the regulators know what they are doing, this is no different. It’s gone through every single one of those processes. And we’ve lived a lot of those processes. So I can tell you the regulators have scrutinised this in great detail, not just in the UK but globally, and have been willing to give it authorisation – and that many regulators can’t be wrong.\\nOxford and AstraZeneca have recently begun testing a reformulated vaccine that is designed to better target new variants, which could also be used as a booster shot.\\nPollard The first design work began in mid-December. At the moment, we’re in a position where we see very good protection [from the current vaccine] against severe disease from the variants that have been circulating. So the question I think will be: do you need a new variant vaccine? I still don’t know, because we need more evidence. Do we need to be ready? Yes. And that’s why we’re developing new vaccines. We hope we’ll have data in the autumn.\\nGilbert We already know from the clinical data that we’re getting good protection against severe disease and hospitalisation against variants. It’s not like the vaccine suddenly doesn’t work at all any more. [Two doses are up to 92% effective at preventing hospitalisation, according to Public Health England data.]\\n‘I wear my mask and hope for the best’: life in one of California’s least vaccinated counties\\nRead more\\nIn June, seven of the Oxford scientists, including Gilbert, Lambe, Pollard, and Green, were named on the Queen’s birthday honours list for their services to public health during the pandemic. For the Jenner and Oxford Vaccine Group, the intensity of the last year is taking its toll.\\nGilbert It’s been gruelling. The last 18 months have been intense, and we’ve had to respond in the best way we could as a team. There has been very little time to think of anything else, and in addition to developing the vaccine we have done what we can to communicate what we know and don’t yet know, making sure that we have scientific justification for anything we say. It has been frustrating, after the enormous care that has been taken at every stage of the work, to see others have not always communicated findings clearly or accurately.\\nPollard It was intense for such a long period of time. We didn’t have any weekends off.\\nRamasamy So many people say that they still feel traumatised by the time working with Covid patients. It was just incredibly awful.\\nBittaye The development of the vaccine in a year is like the modern-day equivalent of landing a human on the moon. It’s a massive achievement. And it all happened on the back of an unprecedented public-private sector collaboration.\\nLambe We and others have sacrificed so much during this pandemic. I don’t want the next generation to have to do that. I don’t want my kids to have to do it. And it’s only a matter of time to the next pandemic – because there will be one. We need to put processes in place so we’re in a better place next time. I worry that we’re going to try to run into the sunset and forget what we’ve learned and what we’ve sacrificed.',\n",

Asked about the underlying cause of the fatal clotting on her brain, he said the clinical evidence “strongly supports the idea that it was, indeed, vaccine induced”.\\n“Based on available clinical information, it seems to be the most likely explanation,” he said.\\nShaw’s death came weeks after the UK’s vaccine advisory panel restricted use of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine to the over-40s, after rare reports of recipients developing unusual blood clots with low platelets. A number of other countries imposed similar restrictions or suspended use of the vaccine entirely.\\nDeaths linked to the clots are even rarer. There have been 72 deaths in the UK after 24.8 million first doses and 23.9 million second doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine.\\nDr Alison Cave, the chief safety officer with the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency which approves vaccines for use in the UK, said the benefits of Covid jabs outweighed the risks and urged people to come forward for vaccination if they are eligible. She said: “Lisa Shaw’s death is tragic and our thoughts are with her family.\\n“As with any serious suspected side effects, reports of fatalities are evaluated by us, including an assessment of post-mortem details if available. We will be reviewing the coroner’s verdict.”\\nThe family issued a statement, which read: “This is another difficult day in what has been a devastating time for us. The death of our beloved Lisa has left a terrible void in our family and in our lives.\\n“She truly was the most wonderful wife, mum, daughter, sister and friend. We have said all we want to say in public at this time and ask to be left alone to grieve and rebuild our lives in private. Thank you.”',\n",
       "  'Israel has one of the highest Covid vaccination rates in the world, having fully vaccinated 78% of people 12 years and over.\\nMany people are surprised at the country’s resurgence of Covid cases since restrictions were lifted in June.\\nIsrael’s vaccination rate is similar to Australia’s plan to start relaxing restrictions when 70% of over-16s are fully vaccinated.\\nMaking up for lost time: Australia needs to speed up to stay in the Covid vaccine race\\nGreg Jericho\\nRead more\\nSo, why are cases surging in Israel? And what can Australia learn from it, particularly as Sydney charts its path out of the pandemic?\\nLet’s break it down.\\nHerd immunity is much harder with Delta\\nAround 25% of Israel’s population is younger than 12, so the whole population’s vaccination rate is only about 60% (including a small proportion of children under 12 with high-risk medical conditions who’ve also been vaccinated).\\nEven with last year’s virus and the use of the Pfizer vaccine, that wouldn’t be enough for herd immunity.\\nThe Delta variant, which has swept the world since April, is much more contagious. It has an R0 of 6.4, which means one infected person on average infects more than six others in the absence of restrictions and vaccinations. This is compared with the strain circulating in 2020, responsible for Melbourne’s second wave, which had an R0 of 2.5.\\nIn Israel, 60% of hospitalised cases are vaccinated. This is something called the “paradox of vaccination” – in highly vaccinated populations, most cases will be in the vaccinated because no vaccine is 100% protective.\\nHowever, the rate of serious cases in Israel is double for unvaccinated under-60s and nine times higher for unvaccinated over-60s, so vaccines remain highly protective against severe outcomes.\\nLifting restrictions too quickly\\nWhat’s clear in Israel (and the United Kingdom and United States) is lifting all movement restrictions and mask mandates after Delta arrived resulted in surging cases. Current vaccines at about 60% uptake weren’t enough.\\nIn the US, southern states with lower vaccination rates are seeing the worst surges, with the majority hospitalised being unvaccinated. Alabama, with 36% fully vaccinated (higher than Australia) is overwhelmed. Hospitals and ICUs are full and the health workforce is in crisis due to infected and quarantined health workers.\\nIt provides a glimpse of what Sydney faces if we lift restrictions without the population being adequately vaccinated.\\nAnd that includes children. In Texas, paediatric ICUs are full and children cannot get beds. This is another warning that we must urgently vaccinate children, at least those 12 years and over, before lifting restrictions.\\nIn Australia, the 70% vaccination rate at which the federal government proposes to begin easing restrictions corresponds to about 56% of the total population vaccinated.\\nIt was modelled on 30 cases at the start of a new outbreak. With Sydney likely facing daily new cases in the thousands (with no change in strategy), the outcomes could be much worse than anticipated.\\nLet’s recap\\nSo, the situation in Israel is caused by several factors:\\nThe Delta variant has some ability to escape the protection offered by vaccines, and the protection seems to wane a bit over time after two doses.\\nPremature lifting of restrictions.\\nThe herd immunity threshold required for Delta is higher, likely over 80% of the whole population, not the 60% achieved in Israel.\\nOver 70% of infections with Delta arise from asymptomatic transmission, which makes it harder to control.\\nCases of Delta breakthrough infection in vaccinated people can be as infectious as in unvaccinated people (though viral load declines faster in vaccinated people).\\nReasons for optimism\\nThere’s a good news story in one of the most highly vaccinated cities in the US, San Francisco, where over 70% of the whole population has been vaccinated and cases are starting to decline.\\nThis is also likely due to the reintroduction of layered social measures such as mask mandates.\\nIsrael has reintroduced a green-pass system of proof of vaccination or a negative test for anyone three years or over accessing public indoor spaces. It has also started vaccinating over-50s with a third dose booster.\\nIt seems a third dose dramatically boosts immunity, even in people with weakened immune systems. The US will soon start offering a third dose for everyone.\\nMany vaccines require three doses for full protection, and it’s too early to know what the final primary immunisation schedule will be. We may end up needing three doses plus regular boosters, or more effective spacing of two doses.\\nThere’s reason to be optimistic because the vaccine pipeline isn’t static. We’ll have vaccines updated to tackle Delta and other variants in time, which will raise their efficacy and lower the herd immunity threshold.\\nWhat about children?\\nIn addition to crippling outbreaks of Delta in schools, new data shows kids 0-3 years old transmit to adults more than older children.\\nUltimately, vaccination of children will be required to fully control Sars-CoV-2, or it will become a pandemic of the young, with unknown long-term, generational health effects for our children.\\nCovid has mutated to become more contagious, more vaccine resistant and more deadly. As a result, there’s no safe “living with Covid” until at least 80% of the whole population is vaccinated, including boosters or vaccines updated to tackle the Delta variant.\\nWe can live with Covid as we do with measles – occasional travel-imported outbreaks that never become sustained – with an ambitious vaccination strategy.\\nEnding restrictions with 80% vaccinated could cause 25,000 Australian deaths, new modelling suggests\\nRead more\\nLifting restrictions with only 60% of the population vaccinated in Australia will result in a resurgence of Covid like Israel, the UK or the US. The health system will be endangered and its workforce will be stricken.\\nTo lift restrictions safely, we should also continue some social interventions such as wearing masks, vaccinating children, ventilating public venues including classrooms, and prioritising frontline health workers for a third dose booster to protect them and the health system.\\nThere’s light at the end of the tunnel. But we need to keep using masks and other restrictions for now, learn from Israel and other countries, protect health workers and hospitals, vaccinate kids, use boosters, await vaccines updated for variants, implement smarter dosing schedules and aim for the most optimal vaccination strategy with equitable vaccine access, everywhere.\\nThis article is republished from the Conversation.

       "  'The Tennessee department of health will reportedly halt all vaccine outreach to teenagers amid a conservative backlash against Covid-19 vaccines for adolescents.\\nThe department’s new guidance, announced in reports and emails reported by the Tennessean, will apply to vaccinations for all diseases – not just Covid-19. If the department issues any information about vaccination, staff will reportedly be required to strip the agency logo from documents.\\nIn a statement to the Guardian, the department did not confirm or deny the reporting.\\n“Being a trustworthy messenger means we are mindful of hesitancy and the intense national conversation that is affecting how many families evaluate vaccinations in general,” a department spokesman said.\\n“Tennessee is on solid footing when it comes to childhood immunisations and will continue to keep information and programming in place for parents. We are simply mindful of how certain tactics could hurt that progress.”\\nThe reporting comes a day after Tennessee’s top vaccine official claimed she was fired to appease conservative lawmakers pushing back against efforts to vaccinate teenagers.\\nDr Michelle Fiscus, medical director for vaccine-preventable diseases and immunisation programs at the state health department, issued a scathing statement to local news, alleging she was fired because “some of our politicians have bought into the anti-vaccine misinformation” and stating she was “afraid for my state”.\\n“It was MY job to provide evidence-based education and vaccine access so that Tennesseans could protect themselves against Covid-19,” Fiscus told the Tennessean. “I have now been terminated for doing exactly that.”\\nA copy of the termination letter reviewed by the paper did not disclose a reason. A spokesman for the department told the Guardian: “We cannot comment on HR or personnel matters.”\\nThe reported decision to end all vaccine outreach means the department will end Covid-19 events on school property and will no longer send postcards or other notices to teenagers reminding them to get their second dose. This outreach will still occur for adults, the Tennessean reported.\\nTennessee, like other southern states, lags behind the national average of Covid vaccination with only 38% of the population fully vaccinated. The state is seeing a rise in Covid positives, last week recording 3,214 active cases including 124 of the highly transmissible Delta variant. The overall death toll is 12,596.\\nFiscus said she believed she was fired after Republicans took offense to a procedural memo she sent to medical providers explaining the state’s “Mature Minor Doctrine”, a legal mechanism allowing inoculation of minors over 14 without parental consent. The memo, based on a rule in place since a state supreme court decision in 1987, was published on social media.\\nFiscus alluded to the growing threat of the Delta variant.\\n“Each of us should be waking up every morning with one question on our minds: “What can I do to protect the people of Tennessee against Covid-19?”’ she said. “Instead, our leaders are putting barriers in place to ensure the people of Tennessee remain at-risk, even with the Delta variant bearing down upon us.”\\nShe added: “When the people elected and appointed to lead this state put their political gains ahead of the public good, they have betrayed the people who have trusted them with their lives.”\\nThe Republican backlash against state efforts to vaccinate eligible school students reached a crescendo in June when several state lawmakers launched hostile questioning of the state health commissioner, Dr Lisa Piercey.\\nOne, Scott Cepicky, accused the department of “peer pressuring” teenagers. Others threatened to repurpose or dissolve the entire department.\\nThe decision to rollback outreach to teenagers was taken directly by Piercey, according to reporting on Tuesday.',\n",
       "  'For many Canadians, spring was a dark period marked by surging coronavirus infections, lockdowns – and the envy of watching their American neighbours get vaccinated en masse.\\nBut for Anita Anand, the country’s public services and procurement minister, the mounting frustration that Canada was being left behind in the global vaccine race didn’t make her lose focus.\\n“I knew that supply was coming. I knew Canada’s position was strong,” she told the Guardian in an interview. “And I continued to say to my team, ‘It is not how you start the race. It is how you finish the race that matters.’ We need to stay focused, and we need to stay determined.”\\nToday, Canada has the highest vaccination rate – of single and double doses – anywhere in the world. Almost 82% of the eligible population age 12 and older have received at least one dose – and 70.3% are fully vaccinated.\\nThe success – a combination of savvy negotiations, financial resources and high trust in public health institutions – has likely prepared it to battle an impending fourth wave, led by the highly-infectious Delta variant. But Canada’s success also underscores the challenges of balancing vaccine procurement with the inequities in global access.\\nCanada: vaccine rollout raises questions on what it can do for poorer nations\\nRead more\\n“We do have pretty good confidence in our governments at all levels and there’s a certain degree of social solidarity, trust in medicine that might not exist in other countries,” said Barry Pakes, a professor of public health at the University of Toronto, on why Canadians were eager to take the doses.\\nWhile widespread social inequities exist in Canada, they are not necessarily as pronounced in other nations, including the United States, he said. “And it helped that we built up a lot of vaccine envy, so there was pent-up interest in getting the vaccine by the time it was able to be delivered.”\\nPublic health campaigns, government incentives and a desire to end the pandemic all played a role in getting a world-leading number of doses into Canadians. But the country’s early work in securing contracts and negotiating with producers also highlight the challenges of a global race for vaccines.\\nEarly on, the Canadian government’s vaccine strategy was to deal with a number of manufacturers before any successful trials had been announced. After Pfizer and Moderna announced successful mRNA results, it was clear Canada’s gamble had paid off.\\n“We knew we had access to those vaccines because of our contracts. And we began to press very, very aggressively for early deliveries from the suppliers,” said Anand, a former professor of corporate governance at the University of Toronto. “From a procurement angle, it’s about getting supply – and how do you get supply? You don’t take your foot off the gas.”\\nBut the vagaries of scarcity economics, failed talks with other nations including the UK to share doses, export controls in Europe and India and “disconcerting” American protectionism – coupled with the reality that Canada had no domestic production – put Anand at an early disadvantage.\\n“That meant even more pressure on me and us to be aggressive at the bargaining table to say to producers ‘We have these contracts and these contracts entitle us to doses’ and ‘We want doses earlier and earlier for our country’.”\\nEven as surging cases and vaccine shortages prompted countries to halt exports, Anand was able to convince producers to speed up deliveries to Canada, getting 28m doses ahead of schedule.\\nBut as it battled the virus at home – and competed with equally desperate nations hunting for a vaccine abroad – Canada’s strategy faced stiff criticism.\\nIn signing multiple deals, Canada also said it would contribute to Covax, enabling it to receive shots through the program, which uses advance purchases by wealthy nations to subsidize doses for poorer countries.\\nIn February, Canada’s decision to take 1.9m doses prompted sharp criticism from public health experts and opposition leaders.\\n“The decision to take a relatively small amount of doses from Covax was one that was made because our country needed vaccines at the time,” said Anand, adding that early in the spring, Canada lagged other nations in first doses. “We were in a position of need. And as soon as we shored up the early supply, we decided not to take any more doses from Covax.”\\nShe said Canada had always expected to donate more globally than it would use domestically.\\n“The question is one of timing. We needed to make sure that we have supply on hand for the domestic population, while at the same time maintaining our commitment to Covax and the developing world,” she said.\\nThe healthcare team bringing vaccines – and hope – to Toronto’s most Covid vulnerable\\nRead more\\nOn Thursday, Anand announced 10m doses of the Janssen vaccine would be donated through Covax, bringing Canada’s total contributions to the vaccine sharing facility to more than 40m doses. But she still faces 22m doses scattered in freezers across the country, 6.5 million people without a shot and the prospect of third booster shots highlights the challenge Anand faces moving forward.\\n“We expect to continue to donate more globally than we will use domestically. But there is a balance to be struck there.”\\nLike other countries that had early surging vaccination rates, Canada has since plateaued. Pakes says the current figures, while giving the country robust protection – still fall short of the level needed for herd immunity.\\n“We’re in a good place compared to the rest of the world. But still it’s nowhere near good enough in order to stop the fourth wave,” he said. “The Canadian summer is pretty short. We’re all very excited to be outside and so we’re in complete denial that fall is coming.”',\n",
       "  'T\\nhe statistics are stark and shaming. During an exasperated intervention earlier this week, the World Health Organization’s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, pointed out that of 4.8bn Covid vaccine doses delivered around the world to date, around 75% have gone to just 10 countries. The level of vaccine donations from richer countries, he added with some understatement, has been “really disappointing”. In Africa, where a third wave of the virus has been on the march since May, less than 2% of the continent’s population has received a first dose. While high-income countries across the globe have administered around 100 doses for every 100 citizens, the equivalent figure for low-income countries is 1.5.\\nAs a consequence, while the United States, Britain and other richer nations begin to roll out programmes for booster shots in the autumn, a pandemic of the unvaccinated continues unabated elsewhere. The WHO’s target of reaching 10% of the population of every country with a first shot by the end of September is unlikely to be met. This grotesque inequity, as Dr Tedros and others have repeatedly pointed out, is ultimately in no one’s interest. Allowing much of the planet to operate as a variant factory, and the more transmissible Delta variant to run riot, stores up trouble for the future. “Vaccinating the world” should therefore be seen as sound strategy as well as an ethical obligation. But, in Europe and North America, early good intentions have so far come a distant second to domestic priorities.\\nGovernments with the means to do so have secured preferential deals for vaccines, over-ordered doses, hoarded them and restricted exports. Britain has played a leading role in opposing calls for intellectual property rights for vaccines to be temporarily waived. Overall, donations from richer countries have not remotely approached the level required. Covax, the vaccine-pooling scheme, has under-delivered, losing its major supply source after India’s decision to ban AstraZeneca exports. On the ground, insufficient time, effort and finance have been devoted to ensuring that the infrastructure is in place to carry out vaccination programmes efficiently, when doses are available. The likely result is that most people in low-income countries will be required to wait until 2023 to be vaccinated. This desperately slow rollout will cost the global economy $2.3tn in lost output, according to a study published today. The brunt of those losses will be borne by the unvaccinated poor.\\nPerhaps more in hope than expectation, the WHO has called for a two-month moratorium on the administering of booster shots in wealthier nations. The politics of such a move would be fraught. But a way must be found to dramatically increase supply to those countries struggling to provide first and second jabs. As the IMF, the World Bank and the World Trade Organization have acknowledged by setting up a joint vaccine taskforce, the level of inequality is untenable. As successive waves of Covid-19 hit richer countries, domestic crisis management eclipsed all other considerations. But if the world is to emerge sustainably from the pandemic, a more strategic and equitable approach is desperately needed.\\nThis article was amended on 27 August 2021.

       "  'NHS England has been told to prepare to administer Covid vaccinations to all children aged 12 and above, as vaccine advisers continue to consider whether to extend the programme, according to reports.\\nThe planned extension to the vaccination programme would coincide with the start of the new school year. NHS trusts have been told to have plans prepared by 4pm on Friday, the Daily Telegraph reported.\\nChildren aged 12-15 in the UK are currently offered coronavirus vaccines only if they have certain health conditions or live with vulnerable people, but distribution of the vaccines has already been extended to that age group by countries such as the US, Germany and Israel.\\nThe Joint Committee on Vaccines and Immunisation (JCVI) has been considering whether to extend vaccine deployment to younger people in the UK, but one member recently admitted the panel was being “very cautious”.\\nChildren very seldom experience serious Covid, meaning that any possible side-effects of vaccines must be weighed carefully against its potential benefits. Rare cases of myocarditis and pericarditis in young recipients of mRNA vaccines such as those made by Moderna and Pfizer have led to concerns in the US, while the Oxford University-developed AstraZeneca vaccine was restricted to the over-40s in the UK after it was found to cause potentially fatal blood clots in some recipients.\\nSpeaking on the Today programme on Radio 4 on Thursday morning, Prof Devi Sridhar, the chair in global public health at the University of Edinburgh, suggested vaccine advisers were being too cautious.\\n“They’re waiting and watching, and I guess the issue with a pandemic is that waiting and watching cost time,” Sridhar said. “Time is the currency now that matters, because it’s not like we can wait and watch and in six months say: OK, it’s safe, let’s vaccinate.\\n“In those six months, if a large percentage of 12- to 15-year-olds get infected, in some ways they’ve lost that window of time. And so I think perhaps they don’t feel the urgency that we should be feeling, given it’s an emergency situation and we have Delta, which is so infectious.”\\nThe Telegraph said it had seen NHS guidance suggesting that 12- to 15-year-olds should be considered competent to decide for themselves whether to consent to being vaccinated. Trusts were being asked to devise plans to begin the distribution of the vaccine in schools on 6 September, with the goal of vaccinating 75% of children by 1 November, the paper reported internal emails as saying.\\nNearly 63% of Britons have so far received two doses of coronavirus vaccine.\\nThe Department of Health and Social Care said it was planning for a range of scenarios. A spokesperson said: “No decisions have been made on vaccinating 12- to 15-year-olds and it is inaccurate to suggest otherwise. Ministers have not yet received further advice from the JCVI on this cohort. We continue to plan for a range of scenarios to ensure we are prepared for all eventualities.”',\n",

And she’s worried that states with low vaccination rates could become hot spots.\\n“Just because we’re lucky in June doesn’t mean we’ll continue to be lucky come the late fall and winter,” said Wen, the former health commissioner for the city of Baltimore.\\n“We could well have variants here that are more transmissible, more virulent and those who do not have immunity or have waning immunity could be susceptible once again.”\\nIn Mississippi, about 835,000 people have been fully vaccinated, or 28% of the population, compared with the national average of 43%.\\nBut despite the lagging vaccination rate, the state’s rolling average of daily new cases over the past two weeks has decreased by about 18%, according to Johns Hopkins.\\nAlbert Ko, who chairs the department of epidemiology of microbial diseases at Yale University, said there was no accurate data to show what percentage of the population in “high burden” states such as Alabama or Texas had been exposed to the virus, but he said estimates had put it as high as 50%.\\n“I think it doesn’t deny the importance of vaccination, particularly because the levels of antibodies that you get that are induced by natural infection are lower than that of what we have for our best vaccine,” Ko said.\\nEven those exposed to the disease should get vaccinated because natural immunity does not last as long as vaccine immunity and the levels of antibodies are lower, Ko said.\\nWen said research strongly suggested that vaccinations provide a benefit to those who already have some antibodies due to infection.\\n“I think it is a fallacy many people have, that recovery means they no longer need to be vaccinated,” she said.\\nThis article was amended on 14 June 2021 to clarify that the decline in national cases from nearly 21,000 to 14,315 occurred over a fortnight, not a week as stated in an earlier version.',\n",

He struggles for breath and hallucinates that his leaden toy soldiers are alive and marching around the room, monstering him with their bayonets.\\nHe has diphtheria, a disease also known as the Strangling Angel. There is a vaccine, but not every child has been inoculated. The bacterial infection creates a membrane across the back of the throat, cutting off air supply.\\nThe little boy’s mother, sitting a desperate vigil next to the oxygen tent, has seen diphtheria take other children.\\nIt will not, in the end, take her son. The membrane will fail to fully close off his airway, and he will emerge from the oxygen tent. He will attend the funerals of classmates who die of diphtheria and polio. He will, in time, run alongside his friend , a fine athlete born blind after his mother contracted rubella during pregnancy. He will rattle a stone in a can to guide his friend to the finish line.\\nThroughout his schooling, children he knows will die from disease.\\n‘I’d like to take anti-vaxxers back in time’, says Tom Keneally, here aged five, shortly before he contracted diphtheria.

He’s my father, and his name is Tom Keneally.\\n“One of the brothers (the Christian Brothers of St Patrick’s College in Sydney’s Strathfield) would come into the classroom from time to time and tell us someone had died,” Keneally said. “We would say a decade of the Rosary for them, and the brother would say that God takes the best children, and I would be relieved I wasn’t one of those.\\n“It didn’t feel like an ever-present threat as kids because we were just living our lives, although I think for our parents it was always there, that possibility.”\\nShortly after birth, Australian children are vaccinated against hepatitis B. Between six weeks and 18 months of age, they receive vaccines against a range of diseases including diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough), pneumococcal disease, meningococcal disease, measles, mumps, rubella, polio, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), rotavirus and varicella (chickenpox).\\nSome vaccines can also protect against certain cancers later in life. As Prof Raina MacIntyre, head of the Biosecurity Research Program at the Kirby Institute and professor of global biosecurity at the University of NSW points out, the hepatitis B vaccine protects against liver cancer, while human papillomavirus vaccine guards against cervical and penile cancer.\\n“People don’t remember the gains we’ve made,” McIntyre says.\\n“In the 19th century, the leading cause of death in children was infectious disease. People would have 10 children and might lose five of them. We lived with high rates of infant mortality,” she says.\\nAs well as two world wars, Australians in the first half of the 20th century had a Spanish flu pandemic and a bubonic plague outbreak to contend with, along with numerous spot-fires of disease.\\nThe lethal diseases that routinely beset the population – such as the choking diphtheria, the crippling polio, the wracking tetanus – made childhood precarious.\\nChild in an oxygen tent in intensive care. 1950-1959. Photograph: Australian Photographic Agency/State Library of NSW\\nOne in 30 children died from gastroenteritis, diphtheria, scarlet fever, whooping cough and measles in 1911. In 1907, infectious diseases killed more than 300 people in every 100,000, according to data from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. By 2019, that number had dropped to around 10.\\nTo modern parents, disease names like polio and smallpox and diphtheria have been relegated by vaccination to arcane words with no practical relevance. But while these cruel diseases no longer kill Australian children, experts say there may be a risk of lapsing into complacency.\\n“The visibility of the ravages of polio, and the fact that most people knew someone who’d had a child die were really powerful drivers, people were desperate for vaccines,” says David Isaacs, clinical professor in paediatric infectious diseases at the University of Sydney, and author of Defeating the Ministers of Death – The Compelling History of Vaccination. “Many younger people have no concept now of how awful it was.”\\nTom Keneally’s diphtheria infection was not to be his last childhood spell in hospital. In 1944 he lay recovering from pneumonia near a boy in an iron lung, suffering from polio. The boy was studying for the Leaving Certificate, the forerunner of the HSC.\\n“He had a bracket above his head that textbooks could be slid into, and I remember him studying Hamlet,” Keneally says. “His mother was always there, turning pages and changing books, and that’s how he studied.”\\nA child lies in an iron lung at the Children’s Hospital 20 May 1938. Photograph: Olson/State Library of NSW\\nSome time later, he learned the boy had died when a power cut rendered his iron lung useless.\\nDr Peter Hobbins, a medical historian at the Australian National Maritime Museum, says polio was still killing children into the 1950s.\\n“It was a reality of life in Australia. A lot of people don’t realise how many diseases were rampant until relatively recently. There’s a reduced visibility of the consequences of these diseases, people don’t appreciate the fear parents felt of sending a child to school and possibly having them not come back into the family,” he says.\\n“Thankfully we are not seeing new cases of polio, but there are still people living with the consequences of the disease, and they feel forgotten.”\\nNot that there weren’t triumphs, notably the eradication of smallpox, which Isaacs says killed up to one in three babies in the London of the 18th and early 19th centuries. A campaign by the World Health Organization, starting in 1967, saw it wiped out by 1980.\\nThe first smallpox vaccinations in Australia were given in the early 1800s. That was no good to the people of the Eora nation. In 1789, a disease believed to be smallpox was introduced by the colonists. It tore through the Aboriginal population of Sydney, killing up to 70%.\\nWhile smallpox is no longer a threat, MacIntyre warns that diseases we have almost forgotten can easily return if vaccination rates slip.\\n“One example is the fall of the Soviet Union,” she says. “There were good vaccination programs, and then when the Soviet Union fell, many stopped being conducted.”\\nAs a result, cases of diphtheria, which had been almost unheard of due to vaccination, reached 140,000, and the disease killed 4,000 children and young adults.\\n“If we stopped vaccinating against diphtheria here, we would see the same,” MacIntyre says.\\nDespite their life-saving properties, vaccines have often been greeted with suspicion. Hobbins says a tragedy in 1928 had an impact on diphtheria vaccination rates – but it may also have ultimately increased vaccine safety.\\n“It became known as the Bundaberg Tragedy, or the Serum Tragedy. A batch of diphtheria vaccine contaminated with Staphylococcus aureus was injected in high doses into 20 children, and 12 died,” he says.\\nDiptheria immunisation, 25 March 1940. Photograph: State Library of NSW\\n“An outbreak of diphtheria could potentially kill 12 children in 20, but that event set the course of vaccination back several years. But one consequence of the tragedy was a rise in manufacturing and quality testing standards, which drastically reduced the risk of that vaccines might become contaminated.”\\nWhile vaccine mandates are sometimes raised as a counter to vaccine hesitancy, they can backfire. In Defeating the Ministers of Death, Isaacs writes of 80,000-strong protests in the UK city of Leicester in the late 19th century, in response to a smallpox vaccine mandate.\\n“I truly believe in negotiation and respecting people’s intelligence, because vaccine hesitancy is not about intelligence. A lot of hesitancy is based on fear and misunderstanding, and we don’t want to alienate people,” he says.\\n“Then you can sometimes bring people around if you’ve developed a close relationship, which is why I’m a firm believer in using GPs to get those messages out.”\\nStill, Australians are very supportive of childhood immunisation, he says.\\nThomas Keneally, Australian novelist, playwright, and essayist. Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian\\n“Our uptake of routine childhood immunisations is about 95%. That’s enough to give you herd immunity, so that there’s no endemic spread of measles at all.”\\nMacIntyre agrees.\\n“Australia has had high rates of vaccination. Anti-vaxxers are around 2%, which is not that much,” she says.\\n“It’s not so much vaccine hesitancy as vaccine confusion [with Covid-19 vaccines]. I believe we can achieve good rates of vaccination [against Covid-19] in Australia.”\\nAs for committed anti-vaxxers, Tom Keneally knows what he would like to do to try to shift their perspective.\\n“I’d like to take anti-vaxxers back in time to my childhood. There would be a story on every street which could change their minds.”',\n",
       "  'Covid vaccines are expected to be offered to children in the UK aged 16 and 17, in line with many other countries, after a minister confirmed government experts will update their advice “imminently”.\\nMichelle Donelan, the universities minister, said the government was expecting an announcement from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) on widening access to the coronavirus vaccine to more teenagers.\\nJust two weeks after the body recommended against routine vaccination of children, two government sources confirmed that the JCVI was reconsidering its ruling. Jabs for over-12s are currently limited to those who are clinically vulnerable or live with someone at risk.\\nThe update in the advice was first revealed by Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, who said on Tuesday that she “hoped” 16- and 17-year-olds would get the go-ahead to receive it after all.\\nAsked why the government was now going ahead with vaccines for 16- and 17-year-olds, Donelan told Sky News: “What we’re doing is waiting for the JCVI announcement; at every stage throughout the pandemic we’ve adopted their advice on this. They are the experts of course when we’re determining the vaccine rollout and we’ll await their imminent announcement shortly.”\\nMinisters are believed to have been in favour of older children getting access to the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, and had asked the JCVI to keep the situation under review.\\nOne of the concerns that the scientists raised, linked to the Pfizer jab, was about inflammation around the heart, with the JCVI concluding that the benefits did not outweigh the risk to those who would be receiving the jabs.\\nThe government is hoping the country is past the worst of the third wave, with daily new cases of Covid across the UK falling to 21,691 on Tuesday and hospital admissions dropping to 731. There were 138 deaths. However, concerns remain about the possibility of the rate of new cases rising again once schools reopen in September, at the same time as many employers are expecting more workers to return to the office.\\nNew findings released from the React 1 study show fully vaccinated people were three times less likely than unvaccinated people to test positive for Covid – around a 50% to 60% reduced risk, including asymptomatic infection. The data from Imperial College London and Ipsos Mori also suggested double-vaccinated people are also less likely to pass on the virus to others.\\nThe study’s estimates are somewhat lower than figures from Public Health England that have suggested 79% protection against symptomatic infection for Delta after two jabs.\\nWhile the React study estimates had a considerable amount of statistical uncertainty, Prof Paul Elliott, director of the React programme, and chair in epidemiology and public health medicine at Imperial College London, said the difference – even when comparing effectiveness against symptomatic Covid – could in part be down to the populations involved, noting PHE’s data is based on those who come forward for testing, rather than a random sample.\\n“[With a] random sample of people, they may have symptoms but they may not go and get a test,” he said.\\nOlder teenagers are one of the groups with the highest levels of Covid infections, so offering vaccinations to children aged 16 and 17 could potentially have a significant impact in dampening transmission.\\nProf Rowland Kao, a participant in the the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (Spi-M) and an epidemiologist at the University of Edinburgh, said: “Per capita, older teenagers currently have the highest risk of Covid-19 infection, and vaccinating 16- and 17-year-olds should reduce this.\\n“Current evidence also suggests that, even when vaccinated individuals get infected, they both are at lower risk of severe disease and their viral load drops more quickly than for unvaccinated individuals, with the likely consequence that they are less likely to infect others, though this is difficult to prove directly.\\n“Thus it is likely that vaccinating older teens will not only protect them, but also help protect others and dampen down any further waves of infection that may occur.\\n“This of course must be counter-balanced by the evidence for occasional side-effects of the vaccines themselves, for which there is some evidence that they occur with higher frequency in younger adults and older teens.\\n“While this risk is low, it is important that the evidence on which any decision that is made on further vaccination of older teens is made clear.”',\n",
       "  'Scott Morrison has put the issue of vaccine mandates firmly in the hands of employers, saying on Friday government legal advice backs the view that bosses may be able to require workers to get a Covid-19 jab, particularly in high-risk fields.\\nWith companies such as Qantas and SPC already indicating they will require staff to get the jab, employer groups and experts warn it is only a matter of time before the issue is tested in court.\\nSo what is the current law around requiring vaccination – and is it ethical for employers to impose such a requirement?\\nWho is required to get a Covid-19 vaccination?\\nAustralia’s policy is that Covid-19 vaccines are strongly encouraged but not mandatory.\\nScott Morrison says mandating vaccines for workers will be left up to businesses\\nRead more\\nFour states (New South Wales, Queensland, Western Australia and South Australia) have imposed public health orders requiring certain types of workers to get the vaccine. These include quarantine, transportation, airport, health services and aged care staff.\\nThe national cabinet has also agreed that by mid-September all aged care workers will need to have had at least one dose.\\nCan employers require vaccination?\\nEmployment law experts, including barrister Ian Neil and Adelaide University professor Andrew Stewart, have argued that employers’ common law power to issue “lawful and reasonable” directions could allow them to require staff to be vaccinated.\\nThis view has been bolstered by two recent Fair Work Commission cases upholding the sacking of staff who refused influenza vaccines in child care and aged care settings.\\nOn Friday, Morrison revealed the solicitor general had given national cabinet his view that the legality of requiring a vaccination depends on the “reasonableness of any direction made to an employee”.\\nMorrison said it was “very clear” that workers in quarantine facilities covered by public health orders could be required to be vaccinated.\\nHe also suggested that it would be reasonable to require employees who “may be in direct contact potentially [with the virus], or [risk] becoming infected” to be vaccinated, such as airline workers.\\n“You have a second tier, which are those who may be working with people who are quite vulnerable,” he said, citing aged care.\\n“A third tier are those who are in a position where they are public facing in their daily work. So we’re talking about retail, supermarkets, things of that nature, working in essential occupations.”\\nMorrison did not commit to releasing the advice, but the Fair Work Ombudsman is updating its guidance to employers to reflect it.\\nHSC students frustrated with last-minute changes to mass Covid-19 vaccination system\\nRead more\\nUntil now, the FWO had advised that “the overwhelming majority of employers should assume that they can’t require their employees to be vaccinated against coronavirus”.\\nBut it now states “official government advice has said that there may be situations where it is reasonable for employers to require an employee to be vaccinated”.\\nWhat is ‘reasonable’?\\nProfessor Stewart told Guardian Australia that while “everything the prime minister said was accurate, it still leaves the position as clear as mud” because lawfulness of an order “comes down to what is reasonable”.\\n“It depends on the employer, on the employee, on the industry, where you are, on what the current circumstances regarding risks of community transmission are, and on time,” Stewart said.\\nHe cited the example of Western Australia, where the low risk of community transmission might make a vaccination requirement unreasonable now, but reasonable in future outbreaks.\\n“You can’t have a blanket rule – there will always need to be exceptions made. But it would be good to know at least where the starting point is.”\\nWill governments require vaccination?\\nMorrison said that “it is not the intention of the commonwealth, nor of the states and territories, to create any special laws in these areas”. Meaning, if employers want to require staff to be vaccinated they will need to do it using existing laws.\\nMorrison noted that a direction to employees would “have to pass that reasonableness test, and they are ultimately decided by the courts”.\\nWhat does business say?\\nThe Business Council of Australia has said any compulsion should be highly targeted to at-risk industries such as meat processing, manufacturing and healthcare; and led by state governments that can make public health orders, rather than being left to the employer.\\nThe Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive, Andrew McKellar, agreed, saying: “The best pathway towards mandating vaccines in workplaces is through clear public health orders.”\\nOn Monday the Australian Industry Group chief executive, Innes Willox, said, “It’s almost certain that, as things stand, there will be a challenge, either through Fair Work or the courts, as to the right or ability of a company to oblige their workforces to be vaccinated. At the moment governments, state and federal, are just leaving this to employers. It’s a pretty untenable situation where employers are being left to their own devices to make decisions as to whether it is lawful and reasonable for them to mandate vaccinations.\\nAustralian unions would also like public health experts to be the ones to determine which industries vaccines are required in, rather than leaving it up to the employer.\\nIs this discriminatory?\\nMorrison said the solicitor general had also advised on whether requiring staff or customers to be vaccinated could infringe discrimination law.\\nModerna Covid vaccine to be available in mid-September while Victoria offers AstraZeneca to over-18s\\nRead more\\nUnder Australia’s discrimination law, it is unlawful to treat a person less favourably on the basis of protected attributes, including gender, race, disability or age.\\n“It would be unlikely that a person being vaccinated or unvaccinated would be related to whether they are of a particular gender, or whether they’re of a particular disability, or of a particular race,” Morrison said.\\n“Not having a vaccine is not a disability. But, of course, if people do have particular medical conditions or issues that might prevent them from being able to be vaccinated, well, of course, that would be a different issue.”\\nStewart warned vaccination requirements could also constitute age discrimination, against younger people who were less likely to be vaccinated, or who refused AstraZeneca due to a higher risk of blood clots in their age group.\\nHe said discrimination on the basis of political opinion was also arguable because of “the small but incredibly vocal minority of Australians opposed not on medical but political grounds”.\\nIs it ethical?\\nDr Sarah Winch, the head of medical ethics at the University of Queensland, said that requiring employees to be vaccinated was “a lot more tricky” than requiring customers, who can choose not to patronise businesses such as restaurants or cruises that impose such a requirement.\\n“The notion of choice when it comes to working is fraught – we don’t really have that much choice if we say I won’t work for this person,” she said.\\n“And it could cause more harm than good: we need our aged care workforce, it’s largely trained on the job, they’re wonderful people, paid appallingly … for work most don’t want to do – then you’re going to say you have to have this injection, they may well walk.”\\nWinch said the “most ethical solution” should include some form of compensation for employees in the unlikely event of an adverse reaction to a vaccine.',\n",

Nationwide 49.8% of Americans are fully vaccinated, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Last week the White House said Missouri, Florida and Texas account for 40% of new coronavirus cases in the US.\\nVaccine hesitancy in the US has been fueled by social media disinformation and rightwing media personalities, who have repeatedly questioned the efficacy and even safety of the vaccine.\\n13:37\\nThis Body: Black America, hope, trust and Covid vaccine trials – video\\nA report by the Center for Countering Digital Hate found in March that the vast majority of Covid-19 anti-vaccine misinformation and conspiracy theories originated from just 12 people, who have a combined following of 59 million people across multiple social media platforms. The dozen include Robert F Kennedy Jr, the nephew of John F Kennedy who has linked vaccines to autism and 5G broadband cellular networks to the coronavirus pandemic.\\nFrase told CNN that the hospital works to accommodate people who ask for secrecy while receiving the vaccine.\\n“Anything we can do to get people in a place that they’re comfortable receiving the vaccine,” she said.\\n“It’s not a large number, but every single person that we can reach who wants to get vaccinated and we can provide that for them, that’s a win. And we take every win that we can get.”\\nThe desire for privacy comes from a fear about how people will respond, Frase said. People who have changed their minds and decided to get the vaccine may have “had some experience that’s sort of changed their mind from the viewpoint of those in their family, those in their friendship circles or their work circles”, she said.\\n“They did their own research on it, and they talked to people and made the decisions themselves,” Frase added.\\n“But even though they were able to make that decision themselves, they didn’t want to have to deal with the peer pressure or the outbursts from other people about them, quote: ‘Giving in to everything.’”',\n",

The company is also due to supply vaccines to eight other countries in the region.\\nThe Thai government, which is struggling to contain the country’s worst outbreak since the pandemic began, has faced growing criticism for being too dependent on one supplier and for a sluggish vaccine rollout. As of 5 June, about 4% of the population had received at least one vaccine dose.\\nOn Monday morning, 986 vaccine centres were opened across the country, and 143,000 people were vaccinated within two hours, according to officials, mostly older people and people with underlying health conditions.\\n“The government will ensure that everyone is vaccinated,” the prime minister, Prayuth Chan-ocha, said in televised comments.\\nFrustration over the speed of the rollout has grown over recent months, as new, more infectious variants have spread in prisons, factories and densely populated areas of Bangkok.

       "  'I\\nt’s hard to explain what it feels like when someone you thought you knew intimately starts to repeat conspiracy theories about the pandemic and vaccines. You don’t really grasp what’s happening immediately: it’s too vast and jarring a realisation to gulp down in one go. So you go through phases. First you clutch at straws. Perhaps it’s a bad joke, or they didn’t really mean it, or they’re just misinformed. Then you enter a stage of hot, disorienting rage and frustrated remonstration. Once that is spent, finally you cool off. But inside you is a leaden realisation that not only is this person you love putting their life at risk: perhaps you never really knew them at all.\\nPeople with the wildest theories about the pandemic can be found in countries even where most people don’t have access to the internet, cable TV or the shock jocks of commercial radio. A common impulse is to write off those espousing conspiracies, consigning them to the casualties claimed by WhatsApp groups, disinformation or silent mental health issues. These things may be true – but vaccine hesitancy is a symptom of broader failures. What all people wary of vaccines have in common, from Khartoum to Kansas, is their trust in the state has been eroded. Without understanding this, we will be fated to keep channelling our frustrations towards individuals without grasping why they have lost trust in the first place.\\nThis mistrust can run so deep that people will trust almost any source of information other than the government. In my birthplace of Sudan, fewer than 1% of the population have been fully vaccinated and ventilators are even rarer than vaccines. The story is much the same in several other African countries, where vaccine availability is so poor that people will drop everything and head to a hospital based on nothing but a rumour that free shots are available that day. But for many other people, those rare lifesaving vaccines sound suspiciously like too much of a good thing.\\nWhen the first batch of donated vaccines was sent to Sudan earlier this year, two vulnerable members of my family rejected them because someone had started a rumour that an electrical power shortage in the country meant vaccines couldn’t be properly stored, and thus they would certainly have “gone off” and be harmful. I and others tried to convince them that, even if that were the case, the worst case scenario was the shots would be ineffective rather than actually harmful. Our efforts were futile. Still, I clutched at those straws, hoping that once the first shots were administered and no harm was reported, my relatives would come round. But their excuses were ready. The new batch was a “reject”, I was told, donated by western countries that sent the vaccines to Africa for some good PR rather than throwing them away.\\nThis sounds like completely irrational behaviour, but in fact it is the opposite. In countries such as Sudan, nothing good, and certainly nothing free, comes from the state. The government is an extractive body that exists not to serve citizens, but to rifle through their pockets and charge them for going about their daily business. Corruption is endemic – from bribing one’s way through traffic violations, to being forced to use private hospitals because government cronies have hoarded medical technology. The state is something that you thrive in spite of. The government’s communication reflects this uneasy relationship. Officials speak to the public either to scold them or spread propaganda, and dissent is banned; in Egypt, doctors who contradicted the government’s account of the pandemic were arrested, while oxygen tanks ran out in intensive care units in Cairo.\\nHow do you try to convince someone that the provision of free and effective Covid vaccines is the exception to the rules they have lived under their whole life? That vaccines are a sudden outbreak of generosity and competence? Suspicion is easily sown, because political systems don’t need to be fully authoritarian to sustain exploitative and dishonest regimes that breed mistrust. You might think there is a dodgy hidden profit motive behind Covid vaccines if you live in the US, for example, where there is extreme political resistance to publicly funded healthcare, an outrageously profitable healthcare and pharmaceutical industry that spends $306m (£221m) on lobbying a year, and exorbitant, unregulated pricing of everything from flu shots to holding your baby after birth. You might, if you lived in the UK, doubt the government’s assurances that the vaccine had been rigorously tested, after seeing senior officials appear to make up pandemic policies as they went along, dragging the nation with them through U-turns and lockdowns whose rules they did not follow themselves.\\nState failure breeds paranoia. And when trust in government breaks down, people turn to personal vigilance. This climate of hesitancy and wariness is heightened by poorly regulated media that trade in falsehoods. In the UK, for example, a misleading report about ethnic minority people being excluded from vaccine trials was resolved only with a short correction in a footnote.\\nVaccine rejection doesn’t happen in a vacuum. It’s easier to dismiss hesitancy and conspiracies as unhinged behaviour; it makes us feel less unnerved by displays of unreason from those who we think are, or should be, rational people. Sure, among vaccine-hesitant people are those who are simply stubborn, misanthropic or selfish. But, just as the pandemic exploited the weaknesses of our economic and public health systems, vaccine hesitancy has exposed the weaknesses of states’ bond with their citizens. There are no easy answers for how to deal with those who repeat conspiracy theories and falsehoods, but scrutinising the systems that lost their trust is perhaps a good place to start.\\nNesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist',\n",

Approximately 35% of 18- to 30-year-olds are unvaccinated, he said.\\nAddressing younger people directly, Johnson said: “Some of life’s most important pleasures and opportunities are likely to be increasingly dependent on vaccination.”\\nLess than 18 hours after almost all Covid restrictions were formally scrapped, allowing clubs to open and putting an end to mandatory masks and social distancing, the prime minister expressed concern about what he called the “continuing risk posed by nightclubs”. From just after midnight on Sunday, thousands of revellers were pictured dancing at clubs across the country as they celebrated “freedom day”.\\nJohnson was delivering a press conference from Chequers, where he is self-isolating after contact with the health secretary, Sajid Javid, who has tested positive for Covid.\\nThe prime minister spoke alongside England’s deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, and the chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, both of whom struck a sombre tone about the challenges ahead.\\nVallance said hospitalisations could rise “quite a lot higher” than 1,000 a day as the lifting of restrictions allows more socialising, while Van-Tam repeatedly underlined the risks of unvaccinated people gathering in crowded indoor venues.\\nAsked what would happen if the NHS struggles to cope over the summer, Van-Tam said the Scientific Advisory Committee on Emergencies (Sage) would have to make recommendations, which could focus on “close contact indoors”.\\nAs ministers scramble to manage the fallout from surging Covid cases, Johnson also announced that “a very small number of named, fully vaccinated, critical workers” would be allowed to return to work after being ordered to self-isolate.\\nThese workers, in sectors such as the police, energy supply, food production and transport, will be allowed to leave quarantine, solely to work, if they take a negative PCR test and continue to have daily rapid tests.\\nTheir employer will have to consult with the relevant government department before allowing them to return.\\nConservative backbenchers were quick to criticise the new plans to make vaccine certificates compulsory for some venues. Former Brexit secretary David Davis said: “Vaccination is sensible. But it is entirely wrong to try to coerce people into having them.”\\nMark Harper, a Tory MP and former chief whip who leads the lockdown-sceptic Covid Recovery Group, suggested the government could struggle to win support for the measures among other Conservatives in parliament.\\nHe said: “I have to say I don’t welcome the minister’s statement, particularly vaccine passports for crowded venues, which is effectively moving to compulsory vaccination. I do however look forward to the debate and the vote in parliament when he will bring forward the evidence because I don’t think that is supported by the pilots that have taken place.”\\nMinisters had previously backed away from the compulsory use of coronavirus certificates – which involve customers using the NHS app to show their vaccination status – in part because of backbench Tory hostility. In a recent vote on compulsory vaccinations for care workers 31 Conservatives rebelled.\\nLabour and the Liberal Democrats oppose the plans, raising the possibility that Conservative rebels could defeat them when they come to parliament in the autumn.\\nJustin Madders, shadow health minister, said: “This make-it-up-as-you-go-along government is causing more chaos when what people and businesses need is certainty. How can it be safe to go to nightclubs now, with no protective measures, if in September it will require double jab status? It makes no sense.”\\nThe Lib Dem home affairs spokesperson Alistair Carmichael said: “Vaccine passports are Covid ID cards: unworkable, expensive and divisive.”\\nBusinesses reacted with fury. Michael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association, said: “What an absolute shambles … The government’s own report into vaccine passports found they were more trouble than they’re worth – so what could possibly explain the about-turn, just as millions across the UK experience their first taste of a night out in a year and a half?”\\nThe latest survey from the Office for National Statistics, carried out in the month to 20 June, found that about 10% of all people aged 16-29 reported being hesitant to get the Covid vaccine, dropping to 5% for those aged 30-49 and 1% for over-50s.',\n",

Even as infection rates ballooned across the state, with no vaccine in sight, a Republican-led state legislature repeatedly thwarted attempts by the Democratic governor, Tony Evers, to issue mask mandates and limit capacity at bars and restaurants.\\nWisconsinites have bifurcated politics, said Mike Wagner, political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Rural and Republican Wisconsinites value independence, hard work and feeling respected, but tend to distrust urban centers and government institutions. They are also more likely to live in less information-rich environments, Wagner said, including cities without daily newspapers. This has spilled over into Wisconsinites’ response to the pandemic.\\nBetween autumn and spring, Wagner surveyed 500 adults, asking about their perceptions of vaccine safety, effectiveness and how likely they would be to take it. He found that while Wisconsinites are generally pro-vaccine, rural residents, Republicans and those who believe the election was stolen from Trump were most likely to be skeptical of the vaccine.\\n“The best predictor of skepticism about vaccines, from our early analyses, is a belief that the election was stolen from President Trump,” Wagner said.\\nFabi Maldonado, a Racine county board supervisor, urges members of the African American and Latino communities to get vaccinated, in March.

That makes these people more hesitant, and particularly in areas that politically are more conservative and more cautious about government,” he said.\\nThe state’s lowest vaccination rate belongs to north-central Wisconsin’s Taylor county, where just over a quarter of the population has received one dose of the vaccine. Almost 72% of voters picked Trump in November’s presidential election.\\nNot everybody who is vaccine-hesitant is driven by political beliefs. In central Wisconsin’s Clark county, just under 26% of the population has received one dose in the second lowest rate in the state. It’s heavily Republican – Trump won 67% of the vote in November. But Clark county is also home to an Amish and Mennonite population of several thousand, groups sometimes referred to as “Plain People” for their choice not to embrace modern dress and technology. Generally, Amish decline vaccines and Mennonites accept only some. Neither has been open to Covid vaccines, Wisconsin Public Radio reported.\\nVaccination appointment slots are going unfilled in Clark county, and medical staff see few walk-ins as demand drops, said Kelsey Wussow, Clark county’s immunization program coordinator.\\n“Vaccine-hesitant folks may not accept the vaccine, no matter what information we provide or how convenient the vaccine service is made,” Wussow told the Eau Claire Leader-Telegram. “At some point, we will have vaccinated everyone who wants the vaccine. I think we may be at that point in Clark county.”\\nVaccine skepticism isn’t exclusive to any one religion or denomination. Father James Altman, a priest in La Crosse, on the state’s western edge, was recently asked by church leaders to resign after he spread misinformation in a church flyer that warned parishioners not to be anyone’s “guinea pig” for an “experimental” injection.\\nAltman is featured in a video recorded on Palm Sunday in which he decried public health restrictions imposed during the pandemic.\\n“You’ve all heard the horror stories, all because godless vermin fed us fear and instituted godless, Nazi-esque controls on all of us and on those we love,” Altman said. Later in the sermon, Altman says that double masking, as promoted by Anthony Fauci, is “godlessness” that is “damnable in the hottest fires of hell”.\\nBuilding trust\\nNot all of Wisconsin’s rural counties trail urban regions. In Door county, a peninsula that juts into Lake Michigan like a hitchhiker’s thumb, more than 56% of the population has received both doses of the vaccine, the highest rate in the state.\\nDoor county is a popular tourist destination, known for its cherries, outdoor getaways and waterfront views. Brian Stephens, president and CEO of Door county medical center, believes its tourist economy may have helped its residents understand early on that getting back to business meant getting vaccinated.\\n“We run on a tourist economy in Door county and our summers are an important time. And so there was a concerted effort to make sure that we get residents, particularly folks who work in the hospitality industry, vaccinated before visitors start coming up in the summer,” Stephens said.\\nStaff at the medical center didn’t stand still, either. In March 2020, when Stephens said vaccines were “still a dream”, the center’s chief medical officer and the director of public health began hosting weekly Facebook events to answer questions from the community about Covid. The Facebook sessions continued.\\n“That format was established and the community came to trust it. We were getting 7,000 views, which is a third to a quarter of our population. So when the information started to come out about the vaccines, that’s what we started to talk about.”\\nAfter 100% of clinicians at the center had been vaccinated, every professional signed a joint letter in support of vaccinations and distributed it on social media.\\n“That was an important piece of this messaging,” said Stephens. “It’s about doctors and healthcare professionals saying, ‘this is what we’re doing and it’s not controversial to us.’”\\nThe Cudahy Smithfield meatpacking plant in Cudahy, near Milwaukee, was partially closed in April 2020 after a Covid-19 outbreak. Many workers at Wisconsin meatpacking plants are Latinos, who have a low vaccination rate. Photograph: Mark Hertzberg/Zuma Wire/Rex/Shutterstock\\nBrad Burmeister, an emergency physician who works at a hospital in Green Bay and nearby Oconto, said medical staff have focused on increasing access by moving from large vaccination sites like the one held at Lambeau Field – home of the Green Bay Packers – to vaccine clinics at employer sites.\\n“Some people might work a 12-hour shift, most days of the week, and they’re just not able to get out of work. They can’t schedule an appointment during the typical hours when they’re working all the time. There’s a lot of different ways we can increase access,” Burmeister said.\\nLike Burmeister, one question all medical professionals interviewed for this story said they were trying to answer is how to more effectively reach Hispanic populations, who lag behind in vaccination rates. That’s particularly important in Green Bay, where early Covid outbreaks hit workers at meatpacking plants, many of them Latinos. In Brown county, where Green Bay is located, only 27% of the Hispanic population has been vaccinated, compared with almost 48% of the non-Hispanic population.\\nA study by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that misinformation may play a large role in hesitancy among Latinos, including a belief that an ID and social security card is required to get vaccinated in Wisconsin, which isn’t the case.\\nWhile combating misinformation is important for all groups, Alison Hanaman, Covid vaccine coordinator at Edgerton hospital and health services in south-eastern Wisconsin, said the most common response she hears when asking why people haven’t been vaccinated is “I just don’t know.”\\n“That’s where the education piece really comes in,” Hanaman said. “I think it’s important that when we talk to people about getting the vaccine that we don’t try to talk them into it per se, or coerce them into it. Be honest, be open and tell them the facts. Then they can make the decision on their own,” she added.',\n",

I strongly encourage all DoD military and civilian personnel – as well as contractor personnel – to get vaccinated now and for military service members to not wait for the mandate,” the defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, said.\\nHe added: “All FDA-authorized Covid-19 vaccines are safe and highly effective. They will protect you and your family. They will protect your unit, your ship, and your co-workers. And they will ensure we remain the most lethal and ready force in the world.”\\nAustin’s plan provides time for the FDA to give final approval to the Pfizer vaccine, which is expected early next month.\\nThe president said: “I strongly support Secretary Austin’s message to the force today on the department of defense’s plan to add the Covid-19 vaccine to the list of required vaccinations for our service members not later than mid-September.”\\nBiden said the country is still on a wartime footing and “being vaccinated will enable our service members to stay healthy, to better protect their families, and to ensure that our force is ready to operate anywhere in the world”.\\nAustin’s memo to the military was issued on Monday as the Biden administration conducts a broader campaign to increase vaccinations in the federal workforce.\\nThe coming mandate reflects similar decisions by governments and companies around the world.\\n“Secretary Austin and I share an unshakable commitment to making sure our troops have every tool they need to do their jobs as safely as possible. These vaccines will save lives. Period. They are safe. They are effective,” Biden said.\\nHe added: “I am proud that our military women and men will continue to help lead the charge in the fight against this pandemic, as they so often do, by setting the example of keeping their fellow Americans safe.”\\nMark Milley, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, issued a memo in support saying the military’s “medical professionals recommended this as a necessary step”.\\nIt continued: “Vaccines are the best tools to protect us from Covid-19. If you have taken the vaccine, thank you. If you have not yet … please do so to protect yourself and those around you.”\\nAustin said in his memo says that the military services will have the next few weeks to prepare, determine how many vaccines they need, and how this mandate will be implemented.\\nThe additional time, however, also is a nod to the bitter political divisiveness over the vaccine.\\nThe decision will add the Covid-19 vaccine to a list of other inoculations that service members are already required to get. Depending on their location around the world, service members can get as many as 17 different vaccines.\\nAustin’s memo also said that in the meantime, the Pentagon will comply with Biden’s order for additional restrictions on any federal personnel who have not been vaccinated. Those restrictions will include wearing masks, social distancing and travel limits.\\nAccording to the Pentagon, more than 1 million troops are fully vaccinated and another 237,000 have received one shot, with the number rising. But the military services vary widely in their vaccination rates.\\nThe navy said that more than 74% of all active duty and reserve sailors have been vaccinated with at least one shot. The air force, meanwhile, said that more than 65% of its active duty and 60% reserve forces are at least partially vaccinated, and the number for the army – by far the largest service – appears to be closer to 50%.',\n",
       "  'State Republican lawmakers across the United States are pushing forward bills that prohibit vaccine mandates in an attempt to give the refusal to have a Covid-19 vaccine the same sort of legal protections as those often surrounding issues of gender, religion and race.\\nMany Republican states are introducing bills that outlaw vaccine mandates within state offices, schools and workplaces, even though vaccine mandates are not commonplace among employers. They also come as the vaccine rollout in the US has slowed markedly, even though the more contagious Delta variant is spreading rapidly, especially among unvaccinated people.\\nDelta variant gains ground in US as outbreaks highlight vaccine divide\\nRead more\\nCovid-19 vaccines are life-saving medications whose side effects are generally mild. Independent expert panels have repeatedly found the benefits of vaccination far outweigh the risk of potential Covid-19 infection. More than 185 million Americans have received at least one vaccine dose.\\n“It’s sort of a solution looking for a problem,” said Lowell Pearson, a managing partner at Husch Blackwell, a firm that has been tracking the bills. “We’re not seeing really any broad sense that employers are requiring vaccines in office settings, in manufacturing settings and other places like that.”\\nMontana passed a bill in April that banned employers from requiring vaccinations authorized under emergency provisions in order to get employment, targeting Covid-19 vaccines. Arizona has pending legislation that would make people exempt from receiving a vaccine if the immunization lacks full approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\\nSouth Carolina introduced a senate bill that prohibits employers from firing, demoting and suspending employees who are unvaccinated.\\nThe legislative push goes in hand in hand with the politicization of the vaccine effort by some Republicans, especially on its more extremist wing. While some Republicans have urged people to get vaccinated, others have sought to cast it as government overreach, often using highly provocative language. The extremist Georgia Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene has likened the vaccination efforts to Nazi Germany and the Turning Point USA founder, Charlie Kirk, has compared it to apartheid.\\nA recent survey by Politico also found that while Democrats supported vaccine mandates and vaccine passports, Republicans opposed, “the government or most employers infringing on their individual choice”. Another poll released by PBS NewsHour/NPR/Marist in March found that 41% of Republicans don’t plan to get vaccinated.\\nSome people refuse to get vaccinated because they are worried about the long-term side-effects and do not trust its FDA approval. All three of the Covid-19 vaccines administered in the US have received emergency use authorization. Experts say most Americans who have yet to be vaccinated are not inherently opposed to vaccines, but face a complex mix of logistical and informational barriers. Surveys show full FDA approval of vaccines could boost uptake particularly among this group. However, experts worry opposition to vaccination has hardened among roughly one quarter of Republicans.\\nThese Republicans bills aim to prevent people from being forced to take the vaccine for employment or educational purposes.\\nUnder the guidance of the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), employers have the right to require vaccination from their employees, a particularly important provision for preventing outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases, such as the flu, in places like hospitals. However, outside the health sector, many choose not to do so.\\nA recent survey of 660 employers found that 72% “will not require or do not plan to require vaccination before entering the workplace”. They are instead encouraging communication about the value of vaccination, offering scheduling flexibility and are considering on-site or near-site vaccination administration for employees.\\n“We have a long history, in this country, of employers not getting into the healthcare decisions of their employees for the most part,” Pearson said. “I think it’s respectful of that tradition and history.”\\nInstead of vaccine mandates, employers are pushing incentives, giving out rewards for employees who do get vaccinated. This adds a little bonus towards getting the vaccine and avoids possible lawsuits from being filed against the employers.\\nKroger and Petco offer money to employees who can prove that they were vaccinated. Target provides up to four hours of paid leave for employees to get vaccinated and even pays for the taxi rides to and from the appointment. Krispy Kreme offered free donuts to people who showed their Covid-19 vaccination record card.\\n“I think most employers do recognize that there is some element of an individual choice of whether to be vaccinated,” Pearson said.',\n",

Julie Willems Van Dijk, a state health department official, has said demand is softening and vaccinators are reducing existing inventories before ordering more doses.\\nIowa health officials have requested 29% of the state’s allotment. Kansas officials asked for 9%, as the state has about 647,000 doses on hand; and Illinois officials say the state has five weeks’ worth of doses on hand and plans to cut its request, also to 9%. Similar patterns were reported by Connecticut – 26% – and South Carolina, 21%.

       "  'Having different Covid vaccines for first and second shots produces a strong immune response to the virus, according to research that will help improve the resilience of vaccine programmes around the world.\\nScientists in Oxford looked at the impact of a mix-and-match approach to vaccinations where people were given either the standard two shots of Oxford/AstraZeneca or Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, or a combination of the two.\\nThe study found marked differences in antibody levels against the virus depending on the shots given. While two doses of Pfizer produced the highest levels of antibodies, one shot of Oxford vaccine followed by a Pfizer booster was nearly as potent.\\nOther combinations were not as effective. Those who had a Pfizer shot followed by an Oxford booster had antibody levels nearly seven times lower than those who had two shots of Pfizer, though this was still five times higher than the antibody levels recorded in people who had two shots of AstraZeneca.\\n“You’ve certainly got an extra kick to your immune system if you boost with the RNA vaccine from Pfizer rather than a booster dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine,” said Matthew Snape, the chief investigator on the Com-Cov trial and associate professor in paediatrics and vaccinology at Oxford.\\nThe findings were released as Prof Sarah Gilbert and colleagues from Oxford received a standing ovation at Wimbledon, where they had been invited to the royal box for the first match on centre court.\\nMinisters are considering whether to offer different vaccines as boosters in the autumn and, based on the Com-Cov findings, following Oxford/AstraZeneca shots with a Pfizer booster may be an effective strategy. “Based on what we’re seeing here, switching over to an RNA vaccine could have some benefits in terms of antibodies,” said Snape.\\nThe Com-Cov trial was designed to see whether mixing Covid vaccines – in the event of a supply shortage, for example – would provide as much protection against the disease as having two doses of the same vaccine.\\nBased on the findings in a Lancet preprint, the scientists believe that any combination of the Pfizer and Oxford vaccines provides a stronger immune response than two doses of the Oxford vaccine, meaning that if the UK or other countries need to mix vaccines, protection should still be substantial.\\nImmune responses were measured in 463 people a month after they were given different combinations of the vaccines four weeks apart. Further data from the study, expected next month, will look at the immune responses when the vaccines are given 12 weeks apart. In the UK, most Covid vaccines are given eight to 12 weeks apart.\\nThe study went on to examine T cell immunity. While antibodies stick to the virus and stop it infecting cells, T cells find and destroy infected cells. Mixing the vaccines had a significant impact, with the strongest T cell activity seen in people who had the Oxford jab followed by a Pfizer booster. The T cell response was half as potent when the Pfizer jab was boosted by the Oxford vaccine, and lower still when both jabs were the same.\\nAnother Oxford study that has yet to be peer-reviewed found that a third shot of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine could work as an effective booster. A third dose given more than six months after the second led to a substantial rise in antibodies and increased the body’s T-cell ability to fight coronavirus, including its variants, scientists found.\\nProf Sir Andrew Pollard, the head of the Oxford Vaccine Group, said it was not yet known whether people would need a booster shot in autumn but the new data showed the existing vaccine could be effective.\\nThe data also shows that a prolonged interval of up to 45 weeks between the first and second dose can also be beneficial, resulting in a significantly higher antibody response after the second dose.\\n“We have countries facing future waves of disease at this moment with a largely unvaccinated population.

A Facebook spokesman said the company permanently bans pages, groups, and accounts that “repeatedly break our rules on Covid misinformation”, including “more than a dozen pages, groups, and accounts from these individuals”.\\nIn the months since the study was released, the CCDH confirmed social platforms have taken action against members of the “dozen”, removing 35 accounts across social media. They have lost 41% of their followers – 5.8 million – but still have 8.4 million followers total and 62 active accounts.\\nMisinformation experts have condemned platforms for taking down some of the most egregious accounts, but not others. For instance, the anti-vaccine figurehead Robert F Kennedy Jr still has an account on Facebook, despite being banned from Instagram, which is owned by Facebook.\\nThe alternative medicine doctor Joseph Mercola also remains on Facebook, where he has made a number of vaccine-skeptical posts in recent weeks that were reshared hundreds of times by his 1.7 million followers. He has also used the platform to promote his anti-vaccination book The Truth About Covid-19.\\nOther research has also shown the scale of the problem remains vast. Many posts falsely imply that the vaccine is not safe, not effective, or not worth getting despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. One prevailing, baseless conspiracy theory is that the vaccine implants users with a tracking microchip.\\nExperts say these posts are particularly prevalent on Spanish-language Facebook – an area of the platform they say Facebook does not devote enough resources to moderating.\\n“Facebook needs a much better mechanism to stop the spread of false information about the vaccine, and they need to make sure they’re doing that across languages,” said Jessica González, the co-CEO at Free Press, a media equity group. She added it is difficult to gauge the scope of the issue when Facebook does not share figures.\\nAccording to the social media watchdog Accountable Tech, 11 out of the top 15 vaccine related-posts on Facebook last week contained disinformation or were anti-vaccine. Another leading post on Facebook about the Covid-19 vaccines last week was a deeply inaccurate anti-vaccine rant from the rightwing Candace Owens, according to FWIW, a newsletter which tracks digital ad spends.\\nAnd the number one Facebook post in the entire country about the vaccine on Friday was Marjorie Taylor Greene calling removal of Covid disinformation “communism”, according to Facebook’s in-house analysis tool Crowdtangle.\\nTaylor Greene – who is not named in the top 12 disinformation spreaders but is often flagged for sharing falsehoods about Covid and other issues – was temporarily suspended from Twitter on Monday.

The administration missed its 4 July target of 70% of Americans receiving at least one Covid-19 vaccine dose. As of 8 July, only 67% American adults had received one dose of the vaccine, while 58% were fully vaccinated.\\nFederal officials are increasingly blaming flagging vaccination rates and rising cases in the US on social media platforms that have failed to police misinformation tied to vaccine hesitancy. “There is an overarching narrative being shared that the vaccine is not effective,” said Vivek Murthy, the US surgeon general, recently. “Health misinformation is a serious threat to public health.”\\nA Facebook spokesman pointed the Guardian to a blogpost penned by Guy Rosen, the vice-president of content policy, in which he asserted the platform’s users have shown increased vaccine acceptance rates over the past six months.\\n“The data shows that 85% of Facebook users in the US have been or want to be vaccinated against Covid-19,” he said. “President Biden’s goal was for 70% of Americans to be vaccinated by July 4. Facebook is not the reason this goal was missed.”\\nThe spread of health misinformation is the latest hurdle for social media firms as they stare down potential antitrust action.

       "  'Since the vaccine rollout began last year, the journey has been relatively smooth. The few bumps that the jab juggernaut has encountered, mostly hiccups in the supply chain, have been successfully navigated.\\nYet there are now concerns about the final stages, with under-30s showing markedly more reluctance to get their first dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines than older people.\\nSo far, 58.4% of 18- to 24-year-olds and 58.9% of 25- to 29-year-olds in England have received a first dose since they became eligible on 18 June according to Public Health England, but that number is now rising slowly enough to alarm NHS trusts.\\nThe latest NHS figures, from 18 July, show that 131,150 people aged 18 to 24 had a first dose that week – barely a third of the 416,434 two weeks earlier. Cities are seeing a slower take-up, with a little more than half of that age group receiving a first dose, and the clinical commissioning groups in Birmingham and Solihull, Leicester city, Liverpool and Manchester have had less than 50% take-up.\\nMany under-30s appear to have understood the message that the virus is most deadly for over-50s to mean that young people are unlikely to be harmed, which they feel is confirmed by the government’s actions.\\nThe ending of restrictions on “freedom day” saw nightclubs reopen after midnight last Sunday to great fanfare, only for Boris Johnson to suggest less than 24 hours later that clubbers might need Covid passports in future. The move, some government sources claimed, was “a ruse to increase vaccine uptake among younger people”.\\nWith case rates rising dramatically for people in their 20s – about one in 100 currently has a seven-day Covid infection, according to Public Health England – it should be no surprise that many of those who remain hesitant about the vaccines believe that ministers do not think it matters if they catch the virus.\\n“We’re reopening the economy when young people generally haven’t had the vaccine and the implication is that it’s fine if they get Covid,” said Evie Aspinall, the head UK delegate to the G7 Youth Summit and a former president of Cambridge University Students’ Union. “They’re telling us there’s no sense of real threat.”\\nClubbers queuing in Brighton in the countdown to ‘freedom day’. Photograph: Chris Eades/Getty Images\\nThe Observer interviewed several 20-somethings who had not yet been vaccinated, and many spoke of anxieties about their health, scepticism about the vaccines and social media scares – as well as a general lack of motivation. “When the government was saying that old people and people with underlying health conditions need the vaccine, I was all for it,” said Mahmud Iqbal, a 26-year-old computer engineer and barber from Tufnell Park, north London.\\n“But then the agenda flipped. The age groups were getting lower and my family started asking me if I was going to take the vaccine.” Having recovered from Covid last year, Iqbal questioned why he needed the jab and spoke of fears about side-effects.\\nKevin, a 24-year-old painter and decorator, said he “didn’t get it for ages” because he was lazy. “I never book GPs or anything until it’s an emergency. But I didn’t realise you can just walk in, so I’ll potentially go now.” Kevin said he found it “unsettling” that he was being asked to take what he described as “an experimental vaccine”. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency authorised the Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines after reviewing clinical trial data, and more than 20 million doses of each have been administered.\\n“I probably will get the vaccine, though, just so I’m less likely to be able to pass it on to vulnerable people,” he said.\\nGeorgia, 28, from the West Midlands said fertility was her chief concern. “I’ve read about a lot of adverse reactions to the vaccine too which puts me off – effects on women’s reproductive systems and cycles. I want to have a baby in the next year and there’s no published data on its long-term effects on fertility. “I just don’t understand why I really need it, I’m healthy and I trust my immune system over the government.”\\nSam Everington, a GP in east London who sits on the British Medical Association council, said that more needed to be done to counter misinformation. “It is difficult, but we need to carry on challenging stuff on social media that is just not true,” he said. “The commonest thing I hear is young people talking about infertility, and there is just no evidence of that.”\\nHe said ministers needed to “stop the mixed-messaging”. “The use of ‘freedom day’ was completely mistaken, because we are going to have to live with Covid. I would much rather use the words ‘next step’. In our local hospitals, a lot of patients now admitted with Covid have not had the vaccination, and they are a younger group. Younger people might think they are immune from Covid or might only get a minor illness, but that’s not true.”\\nAn NHS spokesperson said: “There has been lots of enthusiasm for the vaccine from young people with two-thirds of those aged 18-29 having already had their first dose just a few weeks after becoming eligible, and thousands more continuing to come forward to get vaccinated in convenient places like the walk-in clinic at Ascot Racecourse and vaccine bus at Latitude festival this weekend.\\n“If you haven’t already got your vaccine, there has never been a more important time to come forward – it is quick, effective and lifesaving.”',\n",

       "  'At least 10 out of 26 Indonesian doctors who have died from Covid-19 this month had been fully vaccinated with Sinovac, prompting health experts to consider whether medics should receive alternative doses to boost immunity.\\nIndonesia, which has relied on the Chinese-made vaccine for its health workers, is struggling with a new surge in coronavirus cases. The latest outbreak, driven by new variants, has overwhelmed hospitals and burial sites in Jakarta and on the island of Java. On Monday the country announced 20,694 new infections.\\nIn Kudus, a town in central Java, more than 500 medical workers have tested positive for Covid-19 over the last two weeks, including one doctor who died. All were fully vaccinated.\\nThe data, released by the risk mitigation team of the Indonesian Medical Association (IMA), adds to questions about the level of protection that Sinovac provides against new, more infectious variants. Professional groups representing medics are discussing whether an additional dose of AstraZeneca, Pfizer, or Moderna could provide greater protection.\\nThe vaccine was approved for emergency use this month by the World Health Organization, which said efficacy results showed it prevented symptomatic disease in 51% of those vaccinated, and prevented severe Covid-19 and hospitalisation in 100% of the studied population.\\nHowever, several countries that have vaccinated a large proportion of their population and used the Chinese-made Sinovac or Sinopharm vaccines as part of their inoculation campaigns have reported recent outbreaks. These include Mongolia, Seychelles, Bahrain and Chile.\\nConcerns over the efficacy of Sinovac and Sinopharm has exacerbated the problem of vaccine hesitancy in some countries that are reliant on Chinese-made doses. Last month the Philippine health department said the public would not be told in advance which brand of vaccines would be available at inoculation sites, after people queued up from 2am at a site they believed was offering Pfizer.\\n“The concern for Sinovac is about the published evidence – it is very sparse for Sinovac compared to the other vaccines,” said Dr Pawin Numthavaj, a clinical epidemiologist at Ramathibodi hospital in Thailand, which received a delivery of 2m doses of Sinovac last week.\\nHe said reports of outbreaks in other countries that have replied on Chinese-made vaccines were troubling, as many of Thailand’s health workers had been given Sinovac. “This vaccine may be working, but not for everyone … It’s our job to determine who it is working [for] and who it is not.” Pawin said the Thai government should seek a greater range of vaccines.\\nThe IMA’s risk mitigation team said it believed that overall any Covid vaccine approved by the WHO and the Indonesian authorities was helping to reduce the risk of severe Covid.\\nHowever, it said it was discussing whether health workers should be given an extra dose of an alternative vaccine. “We saw that some countries are supporting a mix-and-match scheme to boost immunity for medical workers,” said Dr Adib Khumaidi, the head of the risk mitigation team. “The most important thing is that [if] taking a Covid vaccine, people should keep doing health protocols,” he said. The group has called for the government to impose tougher lockdown restrictions.\\nOn Monday Indonesian’s food and drug agency approved Sinovac for use in children aged 12-17. The health ministry’s Covid vaccination spokesperson, Dr Siti Nadia Tarmizi, said there was no policy on giving health workers a third dose. She said the number of infections among health workers was driven by their high exposure, including to more infectious variants such as Delta. Most had no symptoms or only mild symptoms, she said.\\nOlivia Herlinda, a policy director at the Centre for Indonesia’s Strategic Development Initiatives, said the Indonesian government had few options regarding its vaccination strategy, given that it had signed agreements with Sinovac.\\n“[I’m] not sure our government has the financial capital to make another deal with other vaccines with better efficacy,” she said. Instead, the government needed to open up access as much as possible, using what was available, she said. “There is a very high demand, but unfortunately, limited supply and facilities.”\\nBetween March 2020 and 26 June 2021, 949 medical workers in Indonesia died after becoming infected with Covid-19, according to the IMA’s Risk Mitigation Team.

       "  'A chorus of activists are calling for changes to intellectual property laws in hopes of beginning to boost Covid-19 vaccine manufacturing globally, and addressing the gaping disparity between rich and poor nations’ access to coronavirus vaccines.\\nThe US and a handful of other wealthy vaccine-producing nations are on track to deliver vaccines to all adults who want them in the coming months, while dozens of the world’s poorest countries have not inoculated a single person.\\nActivists have dubbed the disparity a “vaccine apartheid” and called for the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies to share technical know-how in an effort to speed the global vaccination project.\\n“The goal of health agencies right now is to manage the pandemic, and that might mean not everyone getting access – and not just this year – in the long-term,” said Peter Maybarduk, director of Public Citizen’s access to medicine program.\\nCovid: new vaccines needed globally within a year, say scientists\\nRead more\\n“If we want to change that, if we’re not going to wait until 2024, then it requires more ambitious and a different scale of mobilization of resources,” said Maybarduk. Right now, “it’s not even clear the goal is to vaccinate the world”.\\nThe pressure to get more vaccines to poor nations has also weighed on the Joe Biden administration, which is now considering whether to repurpose or internationally distribute 70m vaccine doses. After outcry, the US has shared 4m AstraZeneca vaccine doses with Canada and Mexico.\\n“There’s no question poorer countries are having a hard time affording doses,” said Dr Howard Markel, a pandemic historian at the University of Michigan School of Public Health. “Even if they were at wholesale or cost there are a lot of different markups.”\\nAs it stands, 30 countries have not received a single vaccine dose. Roughly 90m vaccine doses expected to be distributed through Covax, the global alliance to distribute vaccines to poor countries, have been delayed through March and April by a Covid-19 outbreak in India. In Europe, rising Covid-19 cases and a slow vaccination campaign have also prompted vaccine export controls.\\nBeyond existing vaccine supply, many activists see a bigger fight in patent laws, and are drawing on experience advocating for greater access to antiretroviral drugs for HIV.\\n“More is possible than we believe,” said Maybarduk. “It was assumed Aids drugs could not be produced for less than $10,000 per person per year, right up until the moment they could, and they were produced for $1 per person per day.”\\nSimilarly, Maybarduk said the technology for Covid-19 vaccines, along with other supplies, should be shared among the countries of the world. Activists have used Moderna as a key example of the leverage the US government might have, if it chose to use it.\\nThough popular shorthand often refers to it as just the Moderna vaccine, it was developed in partnership with the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID). American taxpayers provided $6bn in late-stage development funds, in return for potential vaccine doses. It was also tested on Americans, who volunteered for research across 99 research sites.\\n“It is literally the people’s vaccine,” said Maybarduk.\\nPart of the proposal from activists focuses on a petition to temporarily suspend intellectual property laws governing World Trade Organization member states. Suspending those patent laws could urge companies to share technology, they argue, and better protect the whole world from emerging variants that can blunt vaccine efficacy.\\n“This is a classic case where you have an industry that has a very direct stake in protecting itself, and there’s very little understanding among the public how much is at issue,” said Dean Baker, an economist and co-founder of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. Activists argue pharmaceutical companies should share production know-how, and be appropriately compensated.\\nOne part of this fight centers on a provision of international trade law called the Trips agreement, or more formally, the agreement on trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights. Put in force in 1995, Trips requires all member states to recognize 20-year monopoly patents for pharmaceuticals, including vaccines.\\n“What Trips was about was imposing US-European style copyright on the whole world,” said Baker. “Most developing countries had very little idea what they were dealing with.”\\nIn October 2020, South Africa and India introduced a petition to suspend the Trips agreement through the pandemic. India is home to one of the largest generic drug manufacturing industries in the world. South Africa has the largest HIV epidemic in the world, and is part of a group of sub Saharan African countries which were priced out of antiretroviral therapies in the 1990s.\\n“Even if we say, ‘OK, this is highly specialized knowledge’ ... the idea it wouldn’t benefit everyone to share that knowledge is kind of crazy,” Baker said. “The industry’s argument – we’re just stuck – that makes zero sense.”\\nHowever, some vaccine researchers counter that the lack of vaccine access is far more complicated than lifting patent restrictions, because there is so little manufacturing outside of the US and Europe.\\n“In my experience from working on vaccines for the last few decades, the patents are not the biggest problem [and] the intellectual property is not the biggest problem,” said Dr Peter Hotez, a vaccine researcher and dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas.\\nHotez is currently working to develop a low-cost, easily manufactured vaccine that can be distributed in low- and middle-income countries. “The problem with vaccines is having the infrastructure and the human capital to know how to make vaccines,” Hotez said.\\nReliance on these major pharmaceutical companies, Hotez said, has resulted in a dearth of vaccine candidates designed for regional Covid-19 variants and suited for local administration. “We’ve still not fixed a broken financial model for how to get vaccines for the poor,” Hotez said.\\nOn this, both camps agree.\\n“There should be major facilities in Africa and Asia and Latin America, as well as North America, that help respond to future pandemics,” said Maybarduk. “What is not agreed on is what the political economy of that looks like: who controls those facilities, will the technology be openly available, will they be publicly accountable.”\\nThe fight also comes at a time when annual or booster Covid-19 shots appear increasingly likely – in part driven by the possibility variants could emerge in populations without vaccine access – and as pharmaceutical companies eye future profits.\\n“The big players are Astrazeneca, Moderna, BioNtech – these are not really vaccine companies,” said Hotez. They are involved because technological advances will, “provide a glidepath so they can accelerate their technology to down the line make actual money making products”, such as vaccines to treat cancer and neurodegenerative disorders.\\nThe Trips agreement is expected to be discussed again in April, though it is unclear whether the coalition of more than 80 poorer nations will succeed. Opposition to the Trips petition has come from wealthy countries, including the US, which for the last four decades has traditionally argued for enhanced patent protections. It is unclear how the recently confirmed US trade representative, Katherine Tai, might handle the talks.\\n“Here you’ve got the equivalent of a blockbuster vaccine, because everybody needs it,” said Markel. “If you need it every year, boy, what a boon.”',\n",

       "  'T\\no begin with, it felt like a sleek performance from a well-honed relay team. On 11 January, only 10 days after reporting a new respiratory disease, the Chinese published the genome sequence of the virus that causes it. Researchers around the world set to work building vaccines against Covid-19, as the disease became known, and the first candidate entered human trials on 16 March; it was joined, as the months passed, by dozens of others.\\nScientists were jubilant, and they had every right to be. They’d broken all vaccinology records to get to that point. But then tensions began to surface among the team members, and lately even the most distracted spectator will have noticed that they appear to be trying to nobble each other openly on the track. With accusations that the Russians and Chinese hacked research groups in other countries, biotech executives criticised for cashing in on their own, as yet unapproved vaccines, and Russia approving a vaccine that is still in clinical trials, the quest for a vaccine seems to have turned sour.\\nPolitical pressure has been mounting for scientists to deliver an economy-saving result, and reports of corner-cutting emerge daily. Two days before his Republican party’s national convention began last week, president Donald Trump accused the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of dragging its feet, delaying approval of any experimental vaccine until after November’s presidential elections. When the FDA then gave “emergency use” authorisation for blood plasma treatments for Covid-19 patients before such treatments had shown any clear benefit in clinical trials, fears grew that it would do the same for a vaccine candidate before that candidate had been put fully through its paces – just to suit the presidential agenda. And Americans are laggards when it comes to cutting corners. Before Russia approved its vaccine, China also approved a locally made, but not thoroughly tested, vaccine for use in military personnel – and last week it announced that it had been administering an unapproved vaccine to key workers since July.\\nNor is it just politicians who are in a hurry. On 2 August, Steven Salzberg, a computational biologist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, suggested in Forbes magazine that a promising vaccine be rolled out to a wider pool of volunteers before clinical trials had been completed, triggering an outcry (and some sympathy) that prompted him to recant the next day. Meanwhile, a research group with links to Harvard University continues to defend its publication in July of a recipe for a DIY Covid-19 vaccine – one that only the group’s 20-odd members had previously tested. “Out there in the real world, millions of people are getting sick and very large numbers of people are dying every day,” says group member Preston Estep, a genome scientist. “We don’t believe that our vaccine is nearly that much of a risk to people.”\\nAn employee at work at the Gamaleya Research Institute in Moscow. Photograph: Vyacheslav Prokofyev/Tass\\nThe accumulation of such incidents has left many scientists feeling deeply uneasy. “I’m more and more concerned that things are getting done in a rush,” says Beate Kampmann, who directs the Vaccine Centre at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (and whose work email account was subject to a failed hack in July). On 13 August, the editor-in-chief of the journal Science issued a call to order. “Short cuts in testing for vaccine safety and efficacy endanger millions of lives in the short term and will damage public confidence in vaccines and in science for a long time to come,” wrote H Holden Thorp.\\nHe went on to point out that the stakes are higher than with unproven therapies such as hydroxychloroquine, because a vaccine is given to healthy people. “Approval of a vaccine that is harmful or isn’t effective could be leveraged by political forces that already propagate vaccine fears,” he warned.\\nEven if most vaccine research groups aren’t rushing, says Paul Offit, head of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, the language used to describe the search for a vaccine – the US government’s naming of its vaccine funding programme Operation “Warp Speed”, Russia’s evocation of the cold war space race with its “Sputnik V” vaccine, even the expression “vaccine race” – might imply otherwise. “It makes it sound like timelines are being suppressed, or safety issues are being ignored,” he says.\\nDoing things by the book, where testing a vaccine – or any medical intervention – is concerned, involves putting it through a human or clinical trial. This conventionally comprises three phases. In the first, a small group of healthy people receives the vaccine to see if it is safe – that is, that it causes no serious side effects. Phase 2 continues to test safety but mainly tests the vaccine’s ability to elicit an immune response. It does this in a few hundred people, some of whom act as controls because they receive a placebo or different vaccine. In the third phase, which also includes controls, the vaccine is typically administered to tens of thousands of people who are followed over many months, usually in a place where the risk of infection is high. This tests whether the vaccine works in the real world – that it prevents disease – and attempts to root out side effects that might not have been apparent in smaller, less diverse groups.\\nWe don’t have a vaccine for any coronavirus, so why do people assume this is going to be straightforward?\\nAngus Dawson, bioethicist\\nIf an experimental vaccine is judged both safe and effective at the end of this process, it becomes eligible for approval. But it is universally acknowledged that clinical trials can’t catch all possible side effects – because some may only emerge in certain sub-populations, or after a very long time – so surveillance continues post-approval (this is sometimes referred to as a trial’s phase 4). A vaccine against rotavirus, a common cause of diarrhoea in infants, was taken off the market in 1999 after it was found to cause bowel obstruction in a small proportion of babies – something that, because of its rarity, trials had missed.\\nWhen Russia announced earlier this month that it had approved Sputnik V, the vaccine had been tested in no more than 100 people. At the time, the Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology in Moscow – which is running the ongoing vaccine trial – had registered phases 1 and 2 in public databases, but published no results from them, and given no evidence that it had even started phase 3. And this in a country that, at least until five years ago, had by its own health ministry’s admission, standards of drug safety surveillance that were lower than those recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). (Under-reporting of side effects was still a major problem in Russia in 2017.)\\nPhilosopher and bioethicist Angus Dawson, who works at the University of Sydney, says he understands the pressure to accelerate Covid-19 vaccine testing, given the numbers of people globally who are susceptible to severe or lethal forms of the disease. But he thinks it has blinkered some scientists to the dangers of rushing trials. “They’re focusing on potential benefits without reasonably and fairly thinking about the downsides,” he says.\\nPresident Trump visits the Fujifilm Diosynth Biotechnologies Innovation Center in Morrrisville, North Carolina. Photograph: Carlos Barría/Reuters\\nCovid-19 is not flu. It is caused by a virus, Sars-CoV-2, about which relatively little is known, and some of the experimental vaccines currently going through clinical trials also make use of novel technology. That is a lot of unknowns. “We don’t have a vaccine for any coronavirus, so why do people assume this is going to be straightforward?” Dawson asks.\\nOne potential risk with some kinds of vaccine, for example, is that they can cause the recipient to experience a worse bout of the disease if that person becomes infected naturally later on. This phenomenon, known as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), has been a problem with experimental vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) – which is caused by a virus related to Sars-CoV-2 – and it will need to be ruled out by rigorous testing of vaccines against Covid-19.\\nIf ADE were to turn out to be a problem with a vaccine after it had been approved, in a country with poor safety reporting, years might pass before the full human cost came to light. This is a dilemma currently exercising the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, which is working with Covid-19 vaccine developers to set up phase 3 trials in Africa. Covid-19 outbreaks are now growing in parts of that continent, meaning it is potentially a good place to test the ability of a putative vaccine to protect people against infection, but safety surveillance can be patchy there. “Often where you have most cases of an infectious disease, the infrastructure for surveillance isn’t as good,” says Kampmann.\\nWhen Salzberg rescinded his suggestion to roll out a vaccine before trials had been completed, ADE was one of the reasons. “I have concluded that (1) the risks are greater than I presented them, and (2) the benefits are not as great as I had thought,” he wrote.\\nBut unknowns are just that, meaning that experts disagree about how much speed is justified in the current situation. Dawson argues that the existing, sequential system of trial phases should be maintained, partly on moral grounds: safety should be fully established before efficacy, for example, and if it hasn’t then a volunteer giving “informed” consent to take part is less informed than she should be. But the WHO and the Oslo-based nonprofit organisation the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation (Cepi) – which is helping to coordinate Covid-19 vaccine development – have both endorsed a “pandemic paradigm” in which some phases are run in parallel and trial duration is shortened overall. The front-running Oxford University/AstraZeneca vaccine (see graphic, below) is one of a number of projects running phase 2 and 3 trials simultaneously.\\nThe justification for doing so is that all of the usual checks and balances will still be performed before a vaccine is used widely; they just might not be performed in the same order. The cost of compressing the process is a greater financial risk for vaccine-makers, since it requires them to move forward through ever more expensive trial phases before all the information is in from previous ones – with no guarantee of approval at the end. It’s for this reason that Cepi, Warp Speed and others are investing public money in Covid-19 vaccine research – to help spread that risk.\\nAndrew Lo, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, applauds this development. He points out that companies have been fleeing the vaccine field in recent decades, because the profit margin on most vaccines is so thin. “The fact that we now have more companies getting into the vaccine business because of Covid-19 is a tremendously positive aspect of this pandemic,” he says.\\nChinese state firm SinoPharm has been vaccinating key workers before trials for safety and effectiveness have been concluded. Photograph: Zhang Yuwei/AP\\nBut the changing economics of vaccine development have thrown up new ethical dilemmas. Nobody is suggesting that executives at Moderna and Inovio – US biotech firms working on experimental Covid-19 vaccines using technology that has never been approved – broke any rules when they sold off stock in their own companies. This is normal practice, once companies go public, partly because it allows executives to recoup their initial investment. But Lo says legal scholars are currently debating whether those rules remain fit for purpose. And while the scholars debate, the spectacle of execs cashing in on unproven technology that taxpayers helped fund – in the middle of a pandemic, to boot – does nothing for public trust in scientists. “It creates a cynicism that’s understandable,” says Offit.\\nFor Dawson, the bad behaviour now on display is evidence that commercial incentives are too dominant in the search for a vaccine. He points out that other kinds of incentives were possible. The WHO could have offered a prize for the vaccine most likely to reduce the global burden of Covid-19, for example. That might have given it some ownership of the final product, and power to ensure its equitable distribution. Unfortunately, the chronically underfunded WHO doesn’t have the authority many people think it has. “People assume it’s this global power,” Dawson says, “but my university has a bigger budget than the WHO.”\\nVaccines will eventually reach most populations, but only after powerful countries have protected themselves\\nDavid P Fidler\\nThe bad behaviour has repercussions. Now that seven candidates are in phase 3 trials, ensuring the equitable distribution of any that are approved has become a pressing issue. A few weeks ago Cepi published the results of a survey suggesting that the world had the manufacturing capacity to produce the 2bn doses considered necessary to protect the most vulnerable by the end of 2021 – without borrowing capacity from other lifesaving vaccines – but not to produce enough doses to protect everyone by the same deadline. “People are waking up to the fact that vaccines will not be there for all,” Kampmann says.\\nThe spectre arises of nations already engaged in a vaccine “space race” trying to corner supplies for their own populations. In fact, some have already started doing so, prompting the WHO in early August to warn against “vaccine nationalism”. To counter this, in June, Cepi, the WHO and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, set up the Covid-19 Vaccines Global Access (Covax) facility, with the aim of persuading as many governments as possible to invest in vaccine development in exchange for enough doses of an eventually approved product to cover the most vulnerable 20% of their populations.\\nTo date, 172 countries have expressed an interest in Covax. They include the UK, but not China, Russia, the US or the European Union. The deadline to commit is the end of August. Gavi CEO Seth Berkley says he hopes common sense will prevail, and specifically the realisation that nobody is safe until everybody is safe. “To go ahead and cut the final deals, though, we need to know how many countries are going to be in and to have them put in the money up front,” he says.\\nHistory doesn’t give much reason to be hopeful. “In keeping with the longstanding pattern of political behaviour during pandemics,” wrote global health expert David P Fidler of the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington DC, in Science on 14 August, “vaccines will eventually reach most populations, but only after powerful countries have protected themselves.”\\nAnother potential repercussion is that, having lost faith in science and institutions, more people will choose not to take a vaccine once one becomes available – reducing the protection of the population as a whole if herd immunity cannot be achieved. (Herd immunity is when enough people are vaccinated that they block the disease’s spread, so that even the unvaccinated are protected.) Alarming surveys have suggested that up to a third of Americans and 16% of Britons would refuse a Covid-19 vaccine, for example. Offit warns that such surveys should be treated with caution, however, while the vaccine remains theoretical. “If you ask me, would I get a Covid-19 vaccine, my answer would be, not until I’ve seen the data,” he says. “People are sceptical and they should be sceptical.”\\nIf a vaccine is shown to be safe and effective, through rigorous application of the scientific method, Offit is optimistic that most people will take it. Kampmann, meanwhile, feels it’s important not to let the recent shenanigans in the vaccine community overshadow its huge achievements. If current forecasts are correct, a Covid-19 vaccine will be available in 2021 – smashing all records for vaccine development – and there will be many more reasons to trust it than not to. Still, those with their eye on that glittering prize should remember what is at stake. “We have to be careful,” she says, “because what we do with Covid-19 could have repercussions for trust in all vaccine programmes.”\\nLaura Spinney is the author of Pale Rider: The Spanish Flu of 1918 and How It Changed the World (Vintage, £10.99).

       "  'In the United States, to bring about a long-awaited end to the Covid-19 pandemic, federal and state health officials have been urging all Americans to get vaccinated. But, amid stagnating national vaccine rates, some states in the south have been lagging behind when it comes to vaccinating their populations, raising fears of deepening regional disparities.\\nThat raises the prospect that for a complex web of reasons much of the southern US will continue to experience the pandemic in a different way than the rest of America. That is especially worrisome as the south contains more communities that are more vulnerable to the virus.\\nSeveral southern states, particularly in more rural communities, have vaccination rates that are below the national average, according to data provided by the New York Times. In Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana, less than 50% of adults have received at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Georgia, Tennessee, Virginia, South Carolina, and other southern states are currently behind national vaccination rates.\\n“We’re all swimming against a strong current, in some areas, or pretty strong resistance because of the nature of people thinking together and reinforcing doubts about [the] vaccine in their day to day conversations with friends and family who are resistant to being vaccinated,” said Dr Michael Saag, a professor of medicine and infectious diseases at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.\\nLast week Joe Biden and Jill Biden made separate trips to southern states to visit vaccination sites and urge people in the region to get the vaccine.\\nJill Biden holds the hand of a nervous patient upon receiving a vaccination at Jackson State University in Mississippi. Photograph: Tom Brenner/Reuters\\nReasons for the gap in vaccination rates between northern and southern states are disparate and complicated. Hesitancy towards the vaccine, either given an underestimation of the pandemic in general or a fear of fast-developed technology, has been a road block for many. Combined with a generally poor medical infrastructure and many southern state officials providing mixed signaling on vaccinations, lower vaccination rates in the south continue.\\n“There are a lot of different pieces playing a role in why we are where we are,” said Dr Susan Hassig, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Tulane School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine.\\nEven amid the complexity behind the reasons for lowered vaccination rates, the consequences remain clear. The wide-majority of continued Covid-19 deaths are among unvaccinated people. The Delta variant of Covid-19, a more contagious and deadly strain of coronavirus that is currently on the rise, poses an additional threat to pockets of people who do not get the vaccine.\\nThe political undercurrents behind vaccine hesitancy are hard to miss.\\nThroughout the pandemic, Republican politicians – locally and federally – have pushed for ending Covid-19 health measures like mask wearing and social distancing in favor of reopening businesses. More recently, Republican governors have shrugged off concerns of low vaccination rates, including the Mississippi governor, Tate Reeves, despite Mississippi having the lowest vaccination rates nationwide.\\nData also suggests that those living in rural, Republican stronghold areas, and white Republicans in general, tend to be more resistant to the idea of getting vaccinated. According to Forbes, all 16 states that have met the July 4th goal of having at least 70% of their adult population receive one Covid-19 vaccine voted for Democrat Joe Biden in 2020. Additionally, southern cities like New Orleans, as noted by Hassig, which are usually more liberal, have much higher vaccination rates than their rural counterparts.\\n“The common denominator is that these are Republicans stronghold states. These are all deep red states so what we’re seeing in the US is the partisan divide around vaccination rates,” said Dr Peter Hotez, the dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine and the co-director of the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children’s Hospital.\\nBut reducing hesitancy to an extension of political identity can miss the other nuances inherent to vaccine resistance. For many in the south, especially communities that have limited access to often-online Covid-19 information, fear of the vaccine’s short and long-term impact can drive hesitancy, according to Hassig. Similarly, mistrust and confusion around public health information can drive vaccine resistance for many, a sentiment shared across political divides.\\n“Hesitancy is a [catch-all] term that is a front for a very heterogeneous array of components that each need their own approach to address,” said Hassig.\\nStructural inequalities in southern communities, including a limited medical infrastructure, can also be an explanation for lower vaccination rates.\\nSouthern states, in urban and rural communities, can also struggle with a lack of health infrastructure, restricting a person’s access to vaccine information and the ability to make an appointment.\\nPeople arrive to receive Covid-19 vaccinations at a vaccination clinic in Fairfax, Virginia. Photograph: Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images\\nIn rural areas across the US there are “hospital deserts” where no medical facility exists for many miles. Rural communities and many southern cities such as Atlanta and Memphis can also have “pharmacy deserts”, areas where a pharmacy is difficult to access.\\nAdditionally, uninsured people, who are less likely to be connected with a healthcare provider that can provide information on the Covid vaccination process, are disproportionately concentrated in the south, according to data from the US Census Bureau.\\nEspecially for Black and brown residents in the south, who are disproportionately affected by lack of pharmacies and health insurance, vaccination clinics tend to be located away from communities of color, making the vaccination process even more difficult.\\nIn the face of lowered vaccination rates, responses have varied. On a federal level, the Biden administration has implemented programs and campaigns specifically aimed at encouraging vaccines in the region. Biden and the vice-president, Kamala Harris, have also each taken trips to southern states in an attempt to bolster vaccination rates ahead of the July 4th goal.\\nLocal health officials have also taken targeted steps to increase the amount of vaccines in their communities, leaning on community leaders to encourage vaccinations and dispel myths as well as implementing pop-up, sometimes mobile, vaccination clinics in hard-to-reach communities.\\nBut with the mounting threat of the Delta variant and the gap in vaccinations in the south slowly narrowing, experts are concerned about how to more quickly get southern people, especially people of color, vaccinated and protected.\\n“All of those things have pretty much been employed, at least in my community, that I’ve seen first-hand and it is effective to a point, but we aren’t getting where we need to be in terms of a portion of people in our state who have been vaccinated,” said Saag.',\n",

The G7 and G20 can make this happen,” said Tedros.\\nMedical charity Doctors Without Borders questioned how sincere the G7 was in pursuing vaccine equity.\\n“We need to see more clarity around the actual number of doses donated, and exactly how long it’s going to take to translate their pledges into real impact and access,” Hu Yuanqiong at the charity said.\\nAs well as dose sharing, the G7 pandemic battle plan includes commitments to avert future pandemics – slashing the time taken to develop and license vaccines to under 100 days, reinforcing global surveillance and strengthening the WHO.\\nDelta variant Covid symptoms ‘include headaches, sore throat and runny nose’\\nRead more\\nBut observers voiced scepticism of their willingness to follow through on the last point especially.\\n“I will believe [that] point when the contributions to WHO are increased,” tweeted Ilona Kickbusch, founding director and chair of the Global Health Centre in Geneva.\\nOthers stressed the need to quickly resolve the issue of Covid vaccine patent protections, to boost production.\\nFully-fledged negotiations towards a possible suspension of intellectual property protections for Covid vaccines, as well as other medical tools needed to battle the pandemic, have just begun at the World Trade Organization after months of contentious debate.\\nG7 leaders “say they want to vaccinate the world by the end of next year, but their actions show they care more about protecting the monopolies and patents of pharmaceutical giants,” said Max Lawson, Oxfam’s head of inequity policy.\\nHuman Rights Watch agreed. “Focusing on vaccines and making charitable donations are not enough,” Aruna Kashyap, its senior counsel for business and human rights. “The G7’s failure to unequivocally support a temporary waiver of global intellectual property rules is deadly status quo.”\\nWHO and its partners also highlighted the desperate need for funds to overcome the pandemic.\\nMore than $16bn is still needed this year to fully fund efforts to speed up production and access to Covid-19 diagnostics, treatments and vaccines.\\nThat figure represents less that one percent of annual global defence expenditure, the WHO’s emergencies director Michael Ryan said, adding: “Surely we can afford one percent of that to save lives and bring this pandemic to an end.”',\n",

Only 13m actual new doses will be sent to nations in need.\\n“This isn’t new money, and the vaccines don’t seem to be starting to move immediately, so it feels a little bit too little too late,” said Isha Berry, a PhD candidate in epidemiology at the University of Toronto.\\nAlthough large orders from Pfizer and Moderna are arriving each week in Canada, Trudeau’s government instead offered other vaccines.\\nMany are from Novavax, a company whose vaccine has not yet been approved for use in Canada. The remainder are doses that Canada bought through global vaccine-sharing initiative Covax: from AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson, the latter of which has been temporarily suspended in Canada over quality concerns.\\nExperts say there is an urgent need to shift resources to countries to effectively combat the growing threat of more infectious variants of the coronavirus. But many argue that the existing mechanism for vaccine-sharing has fallen short.\\n“Covax ‘was a beautiful idea, born out of solidarity. Unfortunately, it didn’t happen. Rich countries have behaved worse than anyone’s worst nightmares’,” tweeted the medical journal the Lancet.\\nCanada has previously faced criticism as the only G7 nation to draw on the stockpile of donated vaccines meant for poor and middle-income countries.\\nTrudeau’s announcement also reflected a fraught context of vaccine nationalism.\\nAccording to recent polling from Abacus Data, 61% of Canadians believe that it is “morally wrong that people living in richer countries have access to vaccines before those in poorer countries”.\\nBut a survey from the Angus Reid Institute suggests nearly three quarters of Canadians also believe the government should “focus its efforts at home rather than abroad”.\\nBerry cautions against the mentality of pitting countries against each especially when so many nations lack the ability to buy doses directly from manufacturers.\\n“The current global vaccine gap is far worse than most Canadians probably realize,” said Berry. Officials from the World Health Organization have said the pandemic will persist until 70% of the population is vaccinated – a distant goal given current pledges by wealthy nations.\\nCanada’s contributions come nowhere close to the 11bn doses needed globally, but Berry says Canada can nonetheless play a key role by advocating for vaccine patent waivers and helping other nations building capacity.\\n“We all really want to end this pandemic. Everyone’s so tired. But I think there’s also a gap in our global understanding of how bad the global inequities actually are.”',\n",

On Sunday, Fox News personality Neil Cavuto implored viewers to “toss the political speaking points” and get vaccinated. “Life is too short to be an ass,” he said, adding that he expected to be attacked for his views.\\nTelling people to get vaccinated during a pandemic shouldn’t be controversial. Cavuto’s employer has worked overtime to ensure that it is. A recent analysis by a media watchdog found 60% of Fox News’ summer programming included claims undermining vaccinations. While Fox has been amplifying anti-vaxxer propaganda, however, it has also been quietly enforcing its own strict vaccination and testing policies. Nearly 90% of full-time employees at the Fox Corporation have been vaccinated, it was reported last month. The company has also said it will soon implement daily Covid testing for employees who haven’t had the jab.\\nIt has become depressingly clear that we’re not going to end this pandemic by relying on everyone to do what is best for the greater good. If we want to have any hope of getting back to normal then we need strict vaccine and testing requirements – as Fox, for all its posturing about freedom, clearly realises. There are heated debates across the world about how to implement this. Indonesia has made vaccines mandatory, with big fines for refuseniks. While it seems unlikely that most countries will go that far, vaccine mandates for people such as government employees and care workers have been implemented in countries including the US, Australia, France and – from 11 November – in England. As well they should be. There is nothing controversial about requiring people to get inoculated; vaccination requirements for school and travel have been in place for decades.

Neighbouring South Korea, which has also been criticised for a slow vaccine uptake, has inoculated more than 4% of its people.\\nThe health ministry has so far approved only the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, leaving Japan dependent on imports from theEU until the AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines are given the green light, possibly next month.\\nAs of 23 April, just over 1.74 million frontline medical staff had received their first dose, with 878,000 fully vaccinated.

A Kyodo news agency poll this month found more than 60% of people were dissatisfied with Japan’s vaccine rollout, while more than 90% were worried about another wave of infections.\\nInfections driven by new variants soared in Osaka and neighbouring Hyogo prefecture in the month since the prime minister, Yoshihide Suga, fully lifted a targeted state of emergency days before the Olympic torch relay began in late March.\\nQuasi-emergency measures failed to stem the rise, with cumulative infections now at well over half a million and deaths approaching 10,000 – among the worst in Asia.\\nOn Sunday, Tokyo, Osaka and two other virus hotspot regions entered a third state of emergency that includes business closures and fines for non-compliance.\\nBy delaying vaccinations, Japan has left itself vulnerable to new variant outbreaks, with less than 90 days to go before the opening ceremony of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.\\n“Experts are aware that it is too late now to stop the spread of variants with vaccines,” said Riko Muranaka, a lecturer at Kyoto University school of medicine. On Monday, the chief cabinet secretary, Katsunobu Kato, said 21 cases of the Indian “double mutant” variant had been found in Japan, all but one in airport quarantine.\\nMuranaka, who has led high-profile campaigns against vaccine misinformation, traced Japan’s hesitancy to successful class-action lawsuits brought against the health ministry by a small number of parents who claimed – without presenting evidence of a causal link – their children had suffered serious side-effects from various vaccines in the 1980s and 90s.\\nMedia-fuelled controversies, culminating in sensationalist reporting of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, had made the health ministry nervous about encouraging people to have the Covid jab, Muranaka said, adding that the inefficient distribution of doses, including the absence of a centrally managed booking system, had magnified Japan’s problems.\\n“The government takes only limited responsibility for recommending vaccines,” she said. “That is partly to blame for the situation Japan finds itself in now. I’m very pessimistic about the vaccination forecasts. I’m not sure if we will be able to reach herd immunity by the winter. If we continue as we are then variants will spread – the only way to stop that is to vaccinate as quickly as possible.”\\nIn preparation for expected high demand in huge urban centres, large vaccination centres will open in Tokyo and Osaka in the coming weeks in an attempt to speed up the immunisation drive, according to local media reports, with one site in the capital able to administer 10,000 shots a day.\\nOfficials in Tokyo insist the rollout is about to pick up speed, with its vaccination chief, Taro Kono, promising the arrival of 10m doses a week after the Golden Week public holidays in early May.\\nBut the slow pace of immunisation among health workers does not bode well for the rest of the population. Most have yet to receive their first jab, and in some areas unvaccinated medical staff are reluctant to administer shots to older residents.\\nThe rollout is now too far behind to have any impact on the Olympics, with much of Japan’s population unlikely to be protected by the time tens of thousands of athletes, media, officials and other Games-related staff begin arriving in Tokyo ahead of the 23 July opening ceremony.\\nShare your story\\nShare your stories\\nIf you have been affected or have any information, we'd like to hear from you.

       "  \"A\\nt the end of 2020, there was a strong hope that high levels of vaccination would see humanity finally gain the upper hand over Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. In an ideal scenario, the virus would then be contained at very low levels without further societal disruption or significant numbers of deaths.\\nBut since then, new “variants of concern” have emerged and spread worldwide, putting current pandemic control efforts, including vaccination, at risk of being derailed.\\nPut simply, the game has changed, and a successful global rollout of current vaccines by itself is no longer a guarantee of victory.\\nNo one is truly safe from Covid-19 until everyone is safe. We are in a race against time to get global transmission rates low enough to prevent the emergence and spread of new variants. The danger is that variants will arise that can overcome the immunity conferred by vaccinations or prior infection.\\nShould Australians be worried about two countries putting AstraZeneca vaccine rollout on ice?\\nRead more\\nWhat’s more, many countries lack the capacity to track emerging variants via genomic surveillance. This means the situation may be even more serious than it appears.\\nAs members of the Lancet Covid-19 Commission Taskforce on Public Health, we call for urgent action in response to the new variants. These new variants mean we cannot rely on the vaccines alone to provide protection but must maintain strong public health measures to reduce the risk from these variants. At the same time, we need to accelerate the vaccine program in all countries in an equitable way.\\nTogether, these strategies will deliver “maximum suppression” of the virus.\\nWhat are ‘variants of concern’?\\nGenetic mutations of viruses like Sars-CoV-2 emerge frequently, but some variants are labelled “variants of concern”, because they can reinfect people who have had a previous infection or vaccination, or are more transmissible or can lead to more severe disease.\\nThere are currently at least three documented Sars-CoV-2 variants of concern:\\nB.1.351, first reported in South Africa in December 2020\\nB.1.1.7, first reported in the United Kingdom in December 2020\\nP.1, first identified in Japan among travellers from Brazil in January 2021\\nSimilar mutations are arising in different countries simultaneously, meaning not even border controls and high vaccination rates can necessarily protect countries from home-grown variants, including variants of concern, where there is substantial community transmission.\\nIf there are high transmission levels, and hence extensive replication of Sars-CoV-2, anywhere in the world, more variants of concern will inevitably arise and the more infectious variants will dominate. With international mobility, these variants will spread.\\nPrompt vaccine rollouts alone will not be enough to achieve this; continued public health measures, such as face masks and physical distancing, will be vital too\\nSouth Africa’s experience suggests that past infection with Sars-CoV-2 offers only partial protection against the B.1.351 variant, and it is about 50% more transmissible than pre-existing variants. The B.1.351 variant has already been detected in at least 48 countries as of March 2021.\\nThe impact of the new variants on the effectiveness of vaccines is still not clear. Recent real-world evidence from the UK suggests both the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines provide significant protection against severe disease and hospitalisations from the B.1.1.7 variant.\\nOn the other hand, the B.1.351 variant seems to reduce the efficacy of the AstraZeneca vaccine against mild to moderate illness. We do not yet have clear evidence on whether it also reduces effectiveness against severe disease.\\nFor these reasons, reducing community transmission is vital. No single action is sufficient to prevent the virus’s spread; we must maintain strong public health measures in tandem with vaccination programs in every country.\\nWhy we need maximum suppression\\nEach time the virus replicates, there is an opportunity for a mutation to occur. And as we are already seeing around the world, some of the resulting variants risk eroding the effectiveness of vaccines.\\nThat’s why we have called for a global strategy of “maximum suppression”.\\nPublic health leaders should focus on efforts that maximally suppress viral infection rates, thus helping to prevent the emergence of mutations that can become new variants of concern.\\nPrompt vaccine rollouts alone will not be enough to achieve this; continued public health measures, such as face masks and physical distancing, will be vital too. Ventilation of indoor spaces is important – some of which is under people’s control, some of which will require adjustments to buildings.\\nFair access to vaccines\\nGlobal equity in vaccine access is vital too. High-income countries should support multilateral mechanisms such as the Covax facility, donate excess vaccines to low- and middle-income countries, and support increased vaccine production.\\nHowever, to prevent the emergence of viral variants of concern, it may be necessary to prioritise countries or regions with the highest disease prevalence and transmission levels, where the risk of such variants emerging is greatest.\\nWill Australia need more than the Pfizer and AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccines?\\nRead more\\nThose with control over healthcare resources, services and systems should ensure support is available for health professionals to manage increased hospitalisations over shorter periods during surges without reducing care for non-Covid-19 patients.\\nHealth systems must be better prepared against future variants. Suppression efforts should be accompanied by:\\ngenomic surveillance programs to identify and quickly characterise emerging variants in as many countries as possible around the world\\nrapid large-scale “second-generation” vaccine programs and increased production capacity that can support equity in vaccine distribution\\nstudies of vaccine effectiveness on existing and new variants of concern\\nadapting public health measures (such as double masking) and recommitting to health system arrangements (such as ensuring personal protective equipment for health staff)\\nbehavioural, environmental, social and systems interventions, such as enabling ventilation, distancing between people, and an effective find, test, trace, isolate and support system.\\nCovid-19 variants of concern have changed the game. We need to recognise and act on this if we as a global society are to avoid future waves of infections, yet more lockdowns and restrictions, and avoidable illness and death.\\nThis article was first published in The Conversation.

       "  'US regulators on Monday authorized Pfizer and its partner BioNTech’s Covid vaccine for use in children as young as 12, widening the country’s inoculation program even as vaccination rates have slowed significantly.\\nThe vaccine has been available under an emergency use authorization (EUA) to people as young as 16 in the United States. Today’s decision means the FDA is amending the EUA to include children aged 12 to 15. The vaccine makers said they had started the process for full approval for those ages last week.\\n“Today’s action allows for a younger population to be protected from Covid-19, bringing us closer to returning to a sense of normalcy and to ending the pandemic,” said Janet Woodcock, the acting FDA commissioner.\\n“Parents and guardians can rest assured that the agency undertook a rigorous and thorough review of all available data, as we have with all of our Covid-19 vaccine emergency use authorizations,” Woodcock added.\\nAccording to the FDA, about 1.5m cases have been reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in individuals 11 to 17 years of age between March 2020 and April this year.\\nPfizer’s vaccine is being used in multiple countries for teens as young as 16, and Canada recently became the first to expand use to 12 and up.\\nWhile children are far less likely than adults to get seriously ill, the age group represents nearly 14% of coronavirus cases in the US. At least 296 have died in the US after contracting the virus and more than 15,000 have been hospitalized, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP).\\nThe agency also said “the known and potential benefits of this vaccine in individuals 12 years of age and older outweigh the known and potential risks, supporting the vaccine’s use in this population.”\\n“With science guiding our evaluation and decision-making process, the FDA can assure the public and medical community that the available data meet our rigorous standards to support the emergency use of this vaccine in the adolescent population 12 years of age and older,” said Peter Marks, the director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.\\nThe CDC says unvaccinated people – including children – should continue taking precautions such as wearing masks indoors and keeping their distance from other unvaccinated people outside of their households.\\nThe latest news is welcome for many families struggling to decide what activities are safe to resume when only the youngest family members remain unvaccinated.\\nFor Carrie Vittitoe, a substitute teacher in Louisville, Kentucky, who is fully vaccinated, as are her husband and 17-year-old daughter, the FDA decision means her 13-year-old son soon could be eligible, leaving only her 11-year-old son who would be unvaccinated.\\n“I can’t feel totally comfortable because my boys aren’t vaccinated,” Vittitoe told the Associated Press. “We can’t really go back to normal because two-fifths of our family don’t have protection.”\\nPfizer isn’t the only company seeking to lower the age limit for its vaccine. Moderna recently said preliminary results from its study in 12- to 17-year-olds show strong protection and no serious side effects.\\nAnother US company, Novavax, has a Covid-19 vaccine in late-stage development and just began a study in 12- to 17-year-olds as well.\\nThe next hurdle is to test whether the vaccine works for even younger children. Both Pfizer and Moderna have begun studies in children aged from 6 months to 11 years that explore whether babies, preschoolers and elementary-age kids will need different dosages to teens and adults.\\nOutside of the US, AstraZeneca is studying its vaccine among six- to 17-year-olds in Britain. And in China, Sinovac recently announced it has submitted preliminary data to Chinese regulators showing its vaccine is safe in children as young as three.\\nThe AAP welcomed FDA’s decision.\\n“Our youngest generations have shouldered heavy burdens over the past year, and the vaccine is a hopeful sign that they will be able to begin to experience all the activities that are so important for their health and development,” said Dr Lee Savio Beers, the AAP president, in a statement.',\n",

Among the Biden administration’s top priorities has been developing a federal vaccine distribution plan, but states may still lack a steady supply of doses and the personnel necessary to administer what they receive.\\nSome states have begun to expand eligibility to essential workers, people with health conditions, and others.\\nThe Guardian has visualized the proportion of vaccinated population in each state from data provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

       "  'T\\nhere are two ways that getting vaccinated can slow the spread of the virus. First, it can help prevent you getting infected. Second, even if you are unlucky and catch the virus, it may reduce the risk of passing it on. It is crucial to understand how big these benefits are.\\nTwo huge new studies have taken advantage of the successful UK vaccine rollout. An Oxford-ONS analysis of more than 370,000 survey participants found infections were reduced by 65% after a single dose. For protection against the virus, one dose was similar to having had a prior infection. There was no major difference between the two available vaccines.\\nCuriously, infection rates were lower up to three weeks before the jab. Did the virus have magical pre-cognition and keep away? More plausible is the idea of “reverse causation”. People can have the vaccination only if they have not tested positive or shown recent symptoms, so it is inevitable there were fewer recorded infections before vaccinations took place. Statistics can be tricky things.\\nMost important, the studies showed that if you are infected after vaccination, it tends to be much milder, both in terms of self-reported symptoms and viral load.\\nIf vaccinated people develop a weaker infection, then they might be less likely to pass on the virus.\\nThis seems to be the case. Public Health England studied more than 500,000 households in England and estimated that unvaccinated cases infected around 10% of people in their households. But that rate was nearly halved, to around 6%, if the original case had been vaccinated, with a similar reduction from either the Oxford-AstraZeneca or Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines.\\nPut these two studies together and it means that, for every six people that unvaccinated people infect, only one would have been infected had they had the jab.\\nPeople in societies link through their contacts: viruses travel along those links. The evidence builds that Covid-19 vaccines weaken that transmission. By getting vaccinated, you help protect those around you.\\nThe UK vaccine rollout is an extraordinary success: directly protecting people and their contacts and providing vital scientific information to the world.\\nDavid Spiegelhalter is chair of the Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication at Cambridge.

       "  'When vaccines became increasingly available throughout America, US health officials moved quickly to try to convince large numbers of Americans to get vaccinated. But amid the mass vaccination rollout, Black and Latino communities, who are disproportionately affected by the pandemic, have been left behind in vaccination efforts, creating racial disparities about who was more likely to get a Covid-19 shot.\\nAmid federal and local efforts to address vaccine disparity, vaccination rates for Black Americans and Latinos lag behind the general population, leaving many communities of color still unprotected against the Covid-19 pandemic.\\nAmong the 57% of Americans for which ethnicity data was available who have had at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, the majority are white while only about 15% are Hispanic and 9% are Black: both lower rates than their proportion of the US population. Fewer than half of US states have vaccinated more than a third of their Black populations, according to data provided by Bloomberg, while more than 40 states have done at least as well with white and Asian people.\\nWhile some states, like Mississippi, Georgia and Maryland, have seen large increases in vaccination rates among Black and Latino residents in the last week, most US states are still trailing behind on vaccinating communities of color.\\nUS racial inequities in vaccination raise risk of new Covid hotspots and variants\\nRead more\\nThe reasons behind continued disparities in vaccine distribution are complex, ranging from a waning hesitancy towards getting vaccinated to disparities in public health infrastructure that disproportionately impact communities of color. Amid various explanations and some steady progress towards closing the vaccination equity gap, disparity stubbornly remains.\\n“We have structural inequities in everything else, especially in healthcare. You don’t expect a thing like vaccinations to suddenly [make] that disappear,” said Dr Linda Rae Murray, a Chicago physician and former president of the American Public Health Association (APHA).\\nIn many states, early fumblings in the vaccination process have left lingering disparities in place. Missteps around providing accessible information on Covid-19 vaccines, combined with an ongoing level of distrust in institutions, has created vast amounts of misinformation on the vaccines’ efficacy and safety, resulting in some hesitancy, especially early in the vaccination rollout.\\n“We still have people that still have not heard the information that they need to make an informed decision and we still have a range of misinformation out there and we still have some people that are purposely giving people the wrong information,” said Georges C Benjamin, executive director of the APHA.\\nBut vaccine hesitancy is only one reason for why many Black and Latino people remain unvaccinated. Polls from the Kaiser Family Foundation found that hesitation to get vaccinated among Black Americans has gone down in recent months while interest in getting vaccinated among Latinos remained high. In fact, white Republicans are more likely to definitively refuse a vaccination. Similarly, even though Black Americans have similar rates of vaccine hesitancy to white people, white people are more likely to get vaccinated.\\nBeyond individual attitudes, structural inequalities are stifling equitable vaccine access.\\nTransportation to and from vaccination sites has been an ongoing problem for many attempting to get vaccinated. Many low-income people of color don’t have access to a car or live near public transportation that could get them to vaccinations sites.\\nWork and family obligations are another barrier that make it difficult for some to access the vaccine. Early on in the vaccination scramble, even if a person could navigate technological difficulties to secure a long-sought vaccine appointment, getting vaccinated often depended on a person’s availability during the day.\\nFor many frontline workers, the majority of whom are people of color, taking time off to get vaccinated is still not possible. Similarly, taking care of young children or elderly relatives can limit a person’s opportunity to go and get vaccinated.\\n“All of these structural conditions … make it difficult to go out to these mass vaccination places,” said Murray.\\nSome communities of color also struggle with a lack of health infrastructure, resulting in limited access to information on the vaccine or how to schedule vaccine doses.\\nJuanita Ortega, left, receives a Covid-19 vaccine from registered nurse Anne-Marie Zamora at a pop-up vaccine clinic in Los Angeles. Photograph: Jae C Hong/AP\\nIn many major US cities including Chicago, Memphis and Los Angeles, “pharmacy deserts”, a term used to describe a neighborhood with limited pharmacy access, disproportionately impact Black and Latino residents, cutting off access to vaccine appointments at commercial pharmacies. Similarly, as Black and Latino people are less likely to have insurance, they may have irregular contact with a physician who can provide greater information on how to get vaccinated.\\nSome states and municipalities have taken targeted steps to make the vaccination process accessible. Benjamin noted proposals such as going door-to-door to create vaccine appointments, mobile vaccination clinics, and other attempts to create parity among vaccine distribution in many states. New federal initiatives to boost vaccination rates among minorities also include using Black-owned barber shops and hair salons as pop-up vaccination sites and to promote vaccinations as well as providing free Uber and Lyft rides to Covid-19 vaccination sites.\\n“It is important to take the vaccine to the community and not have the community [have] to come to the vaccine,” said Benjamin.\\nBenjamin also described how the federal government has plans in place to help achieve more equitable distribution. “We have states in the United States that historically do poorly on all health statistics. They’re at the bottom of our health outcomes for heart disease, cancer. They have high poverty rates. It’s going to take longer to get them,” said Benjamin.\\nBut as Murray noted, in the absence of any US national health system, states, even ones that historically had poor health outcomes concerning minorities or ones that are still struggling to accurately collect vaccine data on minorities, are tasked with closing the vaccine disparity gap.\\nPlus, stopgap proposals to boost vaccination rates, especially with a looming 4 July deadline, are temporary solutions in the face of structural issues – like lack of pharmacies in a community – that create and exacerbate vaccine disparity. The use of emergency Covid-19 funding to fund short-term proposals versus sustainable investment in public health infrastructure generally leaves structural inequalities unaddressed in the long-term.\\n“That’s like saying, ‘We’re going to hire a few more fire departments for the next year, but if you don’t have a fire department five years from now and there’s a fire, you’re still in trouble’,” said Murray.\\nUltimately, despite some gains in vaccine rates among communities of color, more work needs to be done – now and in the future – to adequately address health inequities pertaining to the vaccine and beyond.\\n“There will be another [pandemic] and it won’t be 100 years from now. It will be sooner than that and if we don’t make these investments in our infrastructure now, if we don’t address the racial inequities that exist in our country … then the next pandemic will see the same kinds of inequities,” said Murray.',\n",
       "  'China is on track to administer 1bn vaccine doses by the end of this week, after bolstering production and distribution networks in an ambitious drive to vaccinate 40% of the population by this month.\\nChinese authorities have been encouraging people to take the free and voluntary doses with cash incentives, gifts and colour-coded signage to laud or shame businesses depending on vaccination rates, as well as the promise of protection against Covid-19.\\nWhile it initially started slowly, with only 80m vaccines delivered by late May, in recent weeks China’s daily rate of injections has increased to about 20m a day. Most have been one of two domestically produced vaccines – Sinopharm and Sinovac.\\nOn Tuesday, the country’s national health commission announced that more than 901m doses of the domestically produced vaccines had been administered in China, state media reported. Per 100 head of population, China has administered a similar number of vaccines as most European nations, according to the New York Times vaccine tracker, but it has a much bigger population to reach, of about 1.4 billion.\\nThe milestone comes as Chinese authorities in the populous city of Guangzhou battle an outbreak of the Delta variant, which was first detected in India. Authorities reported two local cases in Guangdong on Tuesday, and three on Monday, bringing the total to 150. In response to outbreaks, China routinely conducts mass testing of entire cities to locate all asymptomatic and symptomatic cases.\\nWhile numbers are getting under control, and several neighbourhoods have had their restrictions lifted, some health experts have expressed concern at an apparent higher rate of critical cases among those infected. There has also been concern at the infection of two health workers, a rare event in China’s outbreak responses.\\nThe Guangzhou municipal health commission said the two health workers, employees at the city hospital designated to treat Covid-19 patients, were likely to have been infected through accidental exposure.\\nLast week, a Guangdong health official told state media that there had been a higher proportion of critically ill people than during the first Wuhan outbreak and subsequent regional outbreaks in China, and more people showing symptoms.\\nGuangdong province has been under heightened restrictions including travel bans and lockdowns of multiple districts for the past two weeks, after a relative surge in cases late last month. On Monday, restrictions were eased for 11 districts.\\nProf Chan Chang-chuan, of National Taiwan University’s college of public health, said the mass vaccination effort was “really very impressive”, and while it was difficult to verify Chinese government information about the programme, it seemed to be running extensively in cities at least.\\n“Assuming that this is correct this will have a big impact on the herd immunity they are building,” said Chan.\\nProf Chan said China’s expansion manufacturing capabilities had allowed “significant” production of vaccines, and if it kept up to complete all second doses, China could reach herd immunity.\\n“But there is an ‘if’, because even though the WHO has given [emergency use listing] for the two Chinese vaccines, we don’t have empirical data for their effectiveness – we have efficacy,” he said.\\nChan said there was “real world data” for other vaccines like AstraZeneca, Pfizer, and Moderna, which he said showed in most cases that real world effectiveness was a little lower than the efficacy results from controlled clinical trials.\\n“That could be the same for China. The efficacy of both [Chinese] vaccines is not as good as the three others mentioned, so that’s a problem.”\\nHe said there was also a potential issue in China’s vaccines using an inactivated virus of the original strain, and there were multiple new variants.\\n“This in theory will impact on the effectiveness … So they should increase their coverage much higher than other vaccines.”\\nChina’s vaccines have been distributed or donated to many countries around the world, but recent reports have revealed some of the recipient nations, including Bahrain, the UAE, and the Seychelles, have launched or considered booster programmes as they experience fresh spikes in case numbers. Previously vaccinated people are being offered either a third shot of the Chinese vaccine or a new shot with a different type.\\nChan said it was difficult to explain without systemic studies, but it could possibly be that the antibodies produced by the vaccines did not last long enough, or that combating the new variants required a booster shot.',\n",

People in that age group can register their interest online, and it means any mass-vaccination hubs or clinics that are quieter or have unused vaccine can then offer appointments more widely if people in higher-priority categories have not taken up those appointments.\\nYesteday in Sydney Hombush. Really quick. Arrived 10mins before my booking. Went through on time. About 60mins all up. Very quick, no drama ran really smoothly. Was supposed. pic.twitter.com/ljoupml5DA\\n— Sats Moon (@SatsMoonSoon) May 18, 2021\\nPeople on the register of interest list will be contacted as appointments become available, starting with those aged 49 and working back.\\nThe president of the Royal Australasian College of General Practitioners, Dr Karen Price, said she was hearing anecdotally that there were mass vaccination hubs around the country that were quiet.\\n“And yet we also know GPs want to deliver more vaccines and can’t get them,” she said. “Those in their 70s and 80s especially prefer seeing their own doctor over going to a hub. Once younger and more mobile cohorts become eligible for the vaccine, that’s when I think we will see mass vaccination centres really fill up. So I am not saying they don’t have a role.\\n“But of course it is very frustrating to see a mass site with lots of doses while general practices are having to send long-term patients elsewhere because they don’t have enough. It is GPs who are the true mass vaccinators.”\\nThe president of the Australian Medical Association, Dr Omar Khorshid, said once the federal government outlines a plan for opening international borders, people might feel more compelled to get vaccinated.\\n“A certain number of people will go and get the vaccine because it’s the right thing to do,” he said. “A certain number of people will get the vaccine because they really are worried about getting sick with Covid. But there’s an awful lot of people who don’t feel threatened by the virus who don’t see any direct benefit from a vaccine. So they ask ‘why should I get it done?’\\n“Well, we’ve got to answer those questions so that every person can really clearly see the benefits, and weigh them up against the risks, which of course are negligible. And therefore I think setting a date for travel would be helpful.”\",\n",
       "  'Which vaccines against Covid have been approved for children?\\nFollowing successful trials, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine has been given approval in the UK by the medicines regulator for children aged 12-15. It is already approved for that age group in the US, Canada and the EU. The Moderna jab, which is made in a similar way, is also approved for children in the US. They can both be used for older teenagers, since the main trials involved young people over the age of 16. AstraZeneca is now trialling its vaccine in younger children between the ages of six and 17. It is currently approved only for over-18s.\\nWill we now see a vaccination campaign in schoolchildren?\\nNot immediately. The decision on whether to use the vaccines in children in the UK rests with the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), which advises governments. It’s not a straightforward decision scientifically as the risks and benefits for children are not clearcut. It’s also potentially fraught because of different interest groups. Teachers may want children to be vaccinated but some parents may be reluctant and not all doctors think it is a good idea. In the end, the decision will have to be taken by politicians.\\nWhat are the benefits for children?\\nRather less than they are for adults because the vast majority of children generally do not suffer from severe illness when they get infected with coronavirus. A very small minority can get seriously ill from a complication of Covid called multisystem inflammatory syndrome. Although most recover, some have had longer-term mobility problems and mental health issues.\\nThe families of disabled children have been keen for vaccination, because they have been shielding and would like to get back to school and a more normal life. But otherwise the main reason for vaccinating children is to protect adults, such as elderly grandparents, vulnerable relatives and teachers. Because all vaccines carry the small risk of side-effects, the risk-benefit equation is more complex with children.\\nHigh-risk children definitely need vaccination, says Adam Finn, professor of paediatrics at Bristol and a member of the JCVI, but “we need to know who they actually are”. Some have probably been shielding unnecessarily, he says, and urgent work should take place to sort this out. Doctors can in extreme circumstances vaccinate a vulnerable child at their discretion.\\nAre there risks?\\nThere weren’t any major side-effect issues in the children’s trials but they were done in several thousand children – not hundreds of thousands. You don’t see very rare side-effects until you start using vaccines in whole populations. The US has been vaccinating large numbers of children recently, so there should soon be some real-world evidence to look at. In adults, there have been rare cases of blood clots with low blood platelets with the Oxford/AstraZeneca and the Johnson & Johnson vaccines, and those have been a bit more common in younger people. There have also been cases of myocarditis – a heart condition – with the Pfizer/BioNTech jab in Israel. There’s no reason to suppose there will be problems in children, but it’s a bit early to be sure.\\nDo we actually need to vaccinate children?\\nSome say not. They point to Israel, which vaccinated such a high proportion of adults that it eliminated cases in children. But we need to stop children being excluded from school and missing out on education, which happens whenever somebody in a class tests positive. Lately there have been reports in schools of the Delta variant, which originated in India and is more transmissible than other variants in the UK. The variant may also cause more hospitalisations.\\nAre there enough doses to vaccinate schoolchildren?\\nThe UK has ordered 400m doses in total, although not all are available and some of the vaccines are not yet approved. The priority at the moment is getting second doses into adults to ensure they have the best possible protection against the Delta variant in areas where it has taken off.\\nDominic Harrison, the director of public health in Blackburn with Darwen, one of the country’s Covid hotspots, has said they need more supplies and preferably a Twickenham-style mass walk-in vaccination effort to reach younger adults who are most likely to socialise and spread the virus.\\nBut there is also the global need. No country is safe while the virus is unchecked elsewhere, with the likelihood of more and potentially vaccine-evading variants developing. There are calls for the G7 meeting next week in Cornwall to commit to sharing vaccine doses with lower-income countries for everybody’s sake. That would make vaccinating children a lower priority.',\n",

       "  'A decline in daily Covid-19 vaccination rates has left US public health authorities with a new problem – how to effectively shrink operations.\\nIn the campaign to immunize all American adults against the coronavirus, most of the difficulties to date have involved overwhelming demand and restricted supply. Now, with less than one-third of Americans fully vaccinated, local public health authorities described a sense of whiplash as they pivot from mass vaccination clinics to outreach campaigns, all within a couple of weeks.\\nUS split on vaccine passports as country aims for return to normalcy\\nRead more\\n“We knew that when folks became eligible the vaccine-ready folks, or eager, [would] come out right away,” said Mary Jo Brogna, director of nursing at Harbor Health Services, which runs a community clinic in Cape Cod, Massachusetts.\\n“Reaching the final percentage of herd immunity,” believed to be at least 70% of all adults, “is going to be dependent on outreach and addressing any vaccine hesitancy,” said Brogna.\\nFor most of 2021, the story of the vaccine campaign has been overwhelming demand. Emergency authorities took over stadiums, big-box stores and community centers staffed with dozens of nurses and volunteers to inoculate thousands of people per day.\\nBut in the last two weeks daily vaccination rates in the US have peaked and declined from a high of 3.2m daily vaccine administrations per day to 2.5m. Now, health authorities nationally are experiencing what red states such as Mississippi and Wyoming began to see early signs of – a major slowdown.\\n“Across the country we started out with mass clinics and those mass clinics worked very well for the older individuals,” said Gary Edwards, executive director of the Salt Lake County health department in Utah.\\nThe mass-clinic model is not reaching the segment of the population we’re trying to reach\\nGary Edwards\\nHowever, he said, “we’ve reached a point, and it’s been very interesting how quick that happened, that the mass-clinic model is not reaching the segment of the population we’re trying to reach,” said Edwards.\\nThe phenomenon is repeated across the country. Local authorities in Los Angeles, California; Colorado; Florida; Nevada and Texas are poised to close mass vaccination sites by the end of May.\\nGeorgia has already decided to shut down all of its mass vaccination sites by the end of May, citing lack of demand. The state is far behind the nation in terms of administering vaccines, with 34% of the population having received at least one dose, compared with 43% nationally.\\nIn Galveston, the public health director apparently inquired about a “pause” in vaccine shipments, as he worried the district would not be able to use all those shipped before they expire.\\nThe reasons for the slowdown are nuanced, most experts said.\\nVaccine hesitancy, especially among conservatives and racial minorities, is playing a role. But so too are difficulties with scheduling and transportation, as working-aged adults have fallen far behind older adults in terms of vaccination rates.\\nOne of the most notable trends in the immunization campaign is the relatively low rates of vaccination among adults aged 18-49. In this age group, 9-12% of people are fully vaccinated, compared with more than 27% among people aged 50-64.\\n“I had a patient the other day where I was trying to go through the process of online scheduling with him and we just kept hitting a wall,” said Dr Ann Chahroudi, a pediatric infectious disease specialist and faculty at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia.\\nCrucially, his also might be one of the most important groups to vaccinate. In summer 2020, research in the journal Science found that working-aged adults 20-49 were the most likely to transmit the disease to more than one person.\\n“Thus, working adults who need to support themselves and their families have fueled the resurging epidemics in the United States,” an international group of researchers concluded. The same age group appears to be driving cases now in states such as California and Utah.\\nAlso notable is the lack of uptake in conservative regions. Data from the CDC shows states across the south and west have the highest levels of vaccine hesitancy, and uptake is notably low across these states. Multiple polls have now found Republicans are more likely to say they will not get vaccinated.\\n“Reaching those young Republicans and conservative groups becomes a priority, because it’s the difference between normalcy or something less,” said Dr Peter Hotez, a vaccine researcher and the dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College in Houston, Texas. Lack of vaccine uptake, he said, “is not going to be homogeneously distributed. That means Covid-19 becomes a red state disease”.\\nThe politicization of the pandemic and dismissal of science on the right, especially by Donald Trump, has led many influential conservative pundits to question Covid-19 public health measures – from Fox News’s Tucker Carlson to the influential podcaster Joe Rogan.\\n“We’ve got to rip the anti-science out of the Republican party,” said Hotez. “We have to help our conservative brothers and sisters.”\\nHigh levels of vaccine hesitancy are also being blamed for imbalances in supply and demand, such as in Illinois. But, as Cape Cod shows, the whole story is much more nuanced.\\nBarnstable county, known regionally as the Cape, has the lowest rate of vaccine hesitancy in the nation. Just 6% of residents there are believed to be somewhat hesitant, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\\nThe county has administered more shots than any other in Massachusetts, and 59% of people here have received at least one vaccine dose, compared with 43% nationally. In no uncertain terms, it’s a success story. Nevertheless, demand has also stalled at Brogna’s clinics, and public health authorities there are still trying to figure out why.\\n“We’re surveying our own patients,” said Brogna. “We’re reaching out and looking at patients who have not been vaccinated to say, ‘Gee we’ve contacted you three times and noticed you haven’t scheduled a Covid vaccine. Can we talk about it?’” she said.',\n",

But the state-to-state variation is stark.\\nFauci said the administration is “pleading” with states, particularly those with low vaccination rates, to step up their efforts in the coming months, though some of the states trailing behind are hardly sharing the urgency.\\nIn Mississippi, which trails the nation with only about 34% of its population vaccinated, the Republican governor, Tate Reeves, has called Biden’s goal “arbitrary, to say the least”.\\nThe vaccination rate in the state has dropped off so sharply that it would take the better part of a year for the state to reach the 70% target.\\nSpeaking to CNN on Sunday, Reeves said he encouraged residents to get vaccinated, but that the more important marker was the decline in cases in the state.\\nThat sentiment makes winning over people like University of Mississippi student Mary Crane, 20, all the more important to Biden meeting his goal. She hasn’t felt much urgency to get the Covid-19 vaccine because she’s already had the virus, and the family she’s living with during the summer break has been vaccinated.\\n“Initially, it was to wait on everyone else to get it and not take a vaccine,” she said, explaining why she hasn’t been vaccinated. “But now that it’s available, there’s really not a reason I haven’t gotten it, other than I just haven’t gotten it.”',\n",

       "  'The UK’s decision to delay second doses of coronavirus vaccines has received fresh support from research on the over-80s which found that giving the Pfizer/BioNTech booster after 12 weeks rather than three produced a much stronger antibody response.\\nA study led by the University of Birmingham in collaboration with Public Health England found that antibodies against the virus were three-and-a-half times higher in those who had the second shot after 12 weeks compared with those who had it after a three-week interval.\\nMost people who have both shots of the vaccine will be well protected regardless of the timing, but the stronger response from the extra delay might prolong protection because antibody levels naturally wane over time.\\nDr Helen Parry, a senior author on the study at Birmingham, said: “We’ve shown that peak antibody responses after the second Pfizer vaccination are really strongly boosted in older people when this is delayed to 11 to 12 weeks. There is a marked difference between these two schedules in terms of antibody responses we see.”\\nIn the first weeks of the vaccine programme the UK took the bold decision to delay administering booster shots so that more elderly and vulnerable people could more quickly receive their first shots.\\nThe move was controversial because medicines regulators approved both the Pfizer/BioNTech and Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccines on the basis of clinical trials that spaced out the doses by only three or four weeks.\\nResearchers from Oxford University showed in February that antibody responses were more than twice as strong when boosters of their vaccine were delayed for 12 weeks. But the latest study is the first to compare immune responses after different timings with the Pfizer/BioNTech jab.\\nThe scientists analysed blood samples from 175 over-80s after their first vaccine and again two to three weeks after the booster. Among the participants 99 had the second shot after three weeks, while 73 waited 12 weeks. After the second dose, all had antibodies against the virus’s spike protein, but the level was 3.5 times higher in the 12-week group.\\nThe researchers then looked at another arm of the immune system, the T cells that destroy infected cells. They found that T cell responses were weaker when the booster was delayed, but settled down to similar levels when people were tested more than three months after the first shot. Details are published in pre-print form and have yet to be peer reviewed.\\n“This study further supports the growing body of evidence that the approach taken in the UK of delaying that second dose has really paid off,” said Dr Gayatri Amirthalingam, consultant epidemiologist at Public Health England.\\n“Individuals need to really complete their second dose when it’s offered to them because it not only provides additional protection but potentially longer lasting protection against Covid-19.”\\nThe findings come as new data from Public Health England suggested that the vaccination programme had prevented 11,700 deaths by the end of April 2021 in those aged 60 and over, and at least 33,000 hospitalisations in those aged 65 and over in the same period.\\n“Overall, these data add considerable support to the policy of delaying the second dose of Covid-19 vaccine when vaccine availability is limited and the at-risk population is large,” said Eleanor Riley, professor of immunology and infectious disease at the University of Edinburgh.\\n“Longer term follow-up of this cohort will help us to understand which vaccine interval will be optimal in the future, once the immediate crisis is over.”',\n",

Last month Sinopharm became the first Chinese vaccine to be approved by the WHO.\\nThe organisation has also given EUL status to vaccines being made by Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, and the AstraZeneca jab being produced in India, South Korea and the EU, which it counts separately.\\nWHO’s listing paves the way for countries worldwide to approve and import a vaccine for distribution quickly, especially those states without an international-standard regulator of their own.\\nChina forces pace of vaccinations with persuasion … and some cash\\nRead more\\nIt also opens the door for the jabs to enter the Covax global vaccine-sharing facility, which aims to provide equitable access to doses around the world, particularly in poorer countries. Currently only AstraZeneca and some Pfizer jabs are flowing through the scheme.\\n“The world desperately needs multiple Covid-19 vaccines to address the huge access inequity across the globe,” said Mariangela Simao, the WHO’s assistant director general for access to health products.\\n“We urge manufacturers to participate in the Covax facility, share their knowhow and data and contribute to bringing the pandemic under control.”\\n“WHO recommends the vaccine for use in adults 18 years and older, in a two-dose schedule with a spacing of two to four weeks,” the agency said in a statement.\\n“Vaccine efficacy results showed that the vaccine prevented symptomatic disease in 51 percent of those vaccinated and prevented severe Covid-19 and hospitalisation in 100 percent of the studied population.”\\nThe Sinovac vaccine contains an inactivated form of coronavirus that cannot cause the disease. It also has a substance that helps strengthen the immune response to the vaccine.\\nWhen given the shot, the immune system identifies the inactivated virus as foreign and makes antibodies against it, which will then recognise the active virus and defend the body against it.\\nFew people aged over 60 took part in the clinical trial of Sinovac’s jab. However, the WHO said there should be no upper age limit on the vaccine as there is “no reason to believe it has a different safety profile” in older generations.\\nThe Sinovac jab is already in use in 22 territories around the world, according to an AFP count. Apart from China, the countries using Sinovac include Chile, Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, Thailand and Turkey.\\nChen Xu, China’s ambassador in Geneva, said CoronaVac’s EUL status expanded the number of global tools to fight the pandemic.\\n“China will continue to work with the international community to promote the accessibility and affordability of Covid-19 vaccines especially in (the) developing world,” he said in a tweet.',\n",
       "  'Vaccine programmes across Africa and much of the developing world will suffer big delays after the world’s biggest producer said it would not be exporting the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine until the end of the year.\\n“We continue to scale up manufacturing and prioritise India … We also hope to start delivering to Covax and other countries by the end of this year,” Adar Poonawalla, chief executive of the Serum Institute of India (SII), said in a statement on Tuesday.\\n“The Covid-19 crisis has been difficult on people across the globe, including India. In the past few days there has been intense discussion on the decision of our government and Indian vaccine manufacturers, including SII, to export vaccines.”\\nThe delays raise the prospect of hundreds of millions of people around the world waiting until 2022 or even 2023 for vaccination, which will lead to many more deaths and further damage to suffering economies, and could allow new and potentially more harmful variants of the virus to emerge.\\nSII paused deliveries of the AstraZeneca vaccine in March, diverting for domestic use doses that were to be distributed across the developing world. It had been widely hoped that supplies of the AstraZeneca shot, which is suitable for use in countries with weak infrastructure and many poorer countries, would begin again in June or October.\\nHowever, India is battling a wave of infections that has killed more than 283,000 people, according to official figures, which many experts believe are substantial underestimates.\\nSII’s decision is likely to leave the Covax global vaccine-sharing facility, which helps poorer countries, facing a shortfall of hundreds of millions of doses. More than 40 countries in Africa have already received shots from Covax and are relying on further deliveries.\\nThe World Health Organization (WHO), a co-leader of Covax, has called on vaccine makers outside India to advance supplies to the programme to make up the shortfall. Covax aims to provide 2bn vaccines to the developing world in 2021, a target that was always optimistic and now looks impossible to achieve.\\nThe delays will hit India’s neighbours hard. Nepal and Bangladesh are making frantic diplomatic efforts to secure vaccines to prop up their faltering inoculation drives as their stocks run out. Bangladesh said it urgently needed 1.6m shots of the AstraZeneca vaccine to provide second doses.\\nNepal, which started its vaccination drive in January with 2.35m AstraZeneca doses provided by India and Covax, also said it had no stocks and more than 1.5 million people were awaiting second doses.\\n“People above 65 and others in risk groups who received their first shots of the Indian vaccine are waiting for their second,” said Dr Jhalak Gautam, head of the vaccine section of the ministry of health and population.\\n“It’s already overdue,” he said, adding the SII had yet to deliver 1m shots that Nepal bought.\\nGavi, a public-private global health partnership that aims to increase access to immunisation in poor countries and co-leads Covax, has said at least 140m doses that it had expected from SII by the end of May will now remain in India.\\n“As India confronts a truly dreadful wave of the pandemic, Indian vaccine production, including the 140m vaccine doses initially destined for Covax, have been committed to protecting its own citizens,” a Gavi spokesperson told Reuters.\\nCovax has a deal with SII to deliver 1.1bn doses of either the AstraZeneca vaccine or the newer Novavax shot, which has still to obtain regulatory approval.\\nDr Abhishek Rimal, Asia health coordinator for the International Federation of the Red Cross, said the delay would also have a major impact on countries in south-east Asia, which are already facing a rise in cases.\\n“Within one and a half months, the south-east Asia picture has changed completely,” he said. “We are trying to double our primary prevention work going forward so that even if there is no vaccine we are upping our guard.”\\n\\nAfter managing to prevent the worst of the pandemic last year, several countries – including Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia – have seen new waves of infections in recent months.\\nVaccination campaigns have been slow to start across much of the region. The Philippines, one of the worst affected countries, has fully vaccinated less than 1% of the population.\\nDr Siti Nadia Tarmizi, the Indonesian health ministry’s vaccination spokeswoman, said the Serum Institute announcement may affect the country’s Covax supplies, but she believed the WHO and other groups would tackle this. “We still have procurement to AstraZeneca directly, which [it] has committed to send [in] June or July,” she said.\\nAs host of next month’s G7 meeting, Boris Johnson is now under intense pressure to ensure that rescue packages, vaccines and drugs are dispatched from rich nations to halt the spiralling rates of Covid deaths in developing countries and stem further mutations of the virus.\\nNearly one in three (30.7%) recorded deaths from Covid-19 worldwide are occurring in poor and lower-middle-income countries, statistics from earlier this month revealed, a large rise from 9.3% of global deaths earlier this year.\\nGayle Smith, US coordinator on the responses to the pandemic, on Wednesday called on other countries to follow the US lead by increasing financing for Covax and sharing surplus doses with the world’s poorest countries. “The scale that is demanded requires all of us – we cannot do this alone,” she said.\\n“We are encouraging many other countries to put much more financing on the table for Covax. We have got to fill these gaps as quickly as possible … There is a broad consensus that vaccine dose sharing has to be part of our collective strategy.”\\nThe US has contributed $2bn to Covax in recent months. Joe Biden said on Monday that the US would export at least 20m doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson shots, on top of 60m AstraZeneca doses he had already planned to give to other countries.\\nThe US president’s announcement came as the WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, warned that the world had reached a situation of “vaccine apartheid”. The WHO said last month that Africa had given fewer than 2% of vaccinations administered globally and was being left behind.\\nThere have been 4.7m infections and 126,000 deaths from Covid in Africa, according to official figures, though experts believe these do not reflect the true total.',\n",
       "  'The UK’s medicines regulator has approved the use of a fourth Covid vaccine, as cases of the variant of concern first detected in India rise.\\nThe jab from US-based pharmaceutical company Johnson & Johnson is considered a key tool in the global arsenal against Covid, given it is a one-dose regimen, unlike the the other three vaccines approved for UK use that require two shots to provide a high level of protection.\\nThe vaccine is based on an approach J&J used successfully against Ebola. It is similar to the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab, but delivers a protein from the spike of the coronavirus through a human common cold instead of a chimp adenovirus.\\nThe vaccine, made by the US giant’s Belgium-based subsidiary Janssen, was trialled with more than 44,000 people in the US, South Africa and Brazil. Further trials involving a second dose are taking place in the UK. The British government had initially ordered 30m doses but the order was later amended to 20m. The EU has ordered 400m doses.\\nLate-stage data published in January revealed a 66% efficacy rate in preventing moderate-to-severe Covid 28 days after vaccination. Specifically, the jab was found to be 85% effective in preventing severe disease across all regions studied. It also provided 100% protection against hospitalisation and death, as have other vaccines authorised for use globally.\\nThe health secretary, Matt Hancock, said: “This is a further boost to the UK’s hugely successful vaccination programme, which has already saved over 13,000 lives, and means that we now have four safe and effective vaccines approved to help protect people from this awful virus.\\n“As Janssen is a single-dose vaccine, it will play an important role in the months to come as we redouble our efforts to encourage everyone to get their jabs and potentially begin a booster programme later this year.”\\nThe J&J vaccine – which is estimated to remain stable for two years at -20°C (-4°F), at least three months of which can be at normal refrigerator temperatures – has been linked to rare but dangerous blood clots with low platelet counts like the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab, with cases occurring in people under 60, mostly women.\\nThe UK’s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) recommended last month that people under 40 be offered an alternative to the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine given the blood clotrisk. Whether this recommendation will be expanded to the J&J vaccine remains to be seen, but any decision will not have an immediate impact on the UK’s vaccine rollout because doses are not expected to be delivered until later this year.\\nUS health officials lifted an 11-day pause on the vaccine last month after expert advisers determined that the benefits of the shot outweighed the risks. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has recommended a warning should be added to the vaccine’s product information, but has also stressed that its benefits outweigh its risks.',\n",
       "  'The first “tweaked” vaccine against the worrying coronavirus variants that emerged in South Africa and Brazil has successfully neutralised them in laboratory trials, the US company Moderna has said.\\nThe results of the small trial suggest that boosters against the variants will be feasible and could be rolled out this year to counter the threat from variants that have appeared around the world and are feared in some cases to be more transmissible or partially vaccine-resistant.\\nLeading companies have been racing to produce adapted versions of their Covid vaccines. Pfizer/BioNTech, which has a similar mRNA vaccine to Moderna’s, and Oxford/AstraZeneca are also in the process of developing tweaked vaccines against the South African variant, B1351, and the Brazilian variant, P1, which appear to be the major threat to current immunisation programmes.\\nModerna became the first to announce results on Wednesday night. They appear to be very positive, although only basic information from an initial analysis of results is available so far.\\nThe US company has tested both a booster shot of its standard Covid vaccine and also a tweaked version of the vaccine in people who have previously had the full double dose. Twenty adults were recruited for each arm of the trial, or 40 in total.\\nTwo weeks after the new jab, Moderna says both the booster shot and the tweaked vaccine increased the antibodies in the blood that can neutralise the two variants of concern.\\nBut the tweaked vaccine – called mRNA-1273.351 and designed specifically to combat the South African and Brazilian variants, which have similar mutations to the spike protein – produced higher levels of neutralising antibodies than the standard booster shot, mRNA-1273.\\nModerna says it is also running a trial in which people are given a mixture of the booster and the vaccine specifically designed against the variant. It has submitted the early results as a paper to a pre-print server, it said in a statement. Once the combined trial is complete, it will produce a paper that will be published with peer review.\\n“As we seek to defeat the ongoing pandemic, we remain committed to being proactive as the virus evolves. We are encouraged by these new data, which reinforce our confidence that our booster strategy should be protective against these newly detected variants,” said Stéphane Bancel, CEO of Moderna.\\n“Our mRNA platform allows for rapid design of vaccine candidates that incorporate key virus mutations, potentially allowing for faster development of future alternative variant-matched vaccines should they be needed … We will continue to make as many updates to our Covid-19 vaccine as necessary to control the pandemic.”\\nThe vaccines have not been trialled in the field; these are blood samples analysed in the lab. But the regulatory authorities have said they would not need to go through the rigorous large-scale trials that were necessary for the original vaccines to obtain emergency approval.\\nThe company said there were few side-effects from the vaccines and those that were reported were mild. Apart from pain at the injection site, the most common reported side-effects were fatigue, headache, muscle pain and joint pain.',\n",

Some businesses and lawmakers believe they have a simple solution that will allow people to gather in larger numbers again: vaccine passports.\\nBut as with so many issues in the US these days, it’s an idea dividing America.\\nUK drops plans for mandatory ‘Covid passports’ in pubs and restaurants\\nRead more\\nVaccine passport supporters see a future where people would have an app on their phone that would include their vaccine information, similar to the paper record card from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that is given when a person is vaccinated. People would flash the app when entering a large venue for something like a concert or sports game.\\nWhile many other countries have implemented or are considering vaccine passports, in a country where political divides have determined belief in mask usage, social distancing and even the lethality of the virus, it comes as no surprise that there is already a political divide over whether vaccine passports should be used at all.\\nLeaders of some Democratic states have embraced the idea of vaccine passports at big events like concerts and weddings.\\nNew York launched its Excelsior Pass with IBM in late March with the intention of having the app used at theaters, sports stadiums and event venues. California health officials will allow venues that verify whether someone has gotten the vaccine or tested negative to hold larger events. Hawaii is working with multiple companies on a vaccine passport system that would allow travelers to bypass Covid-19 testing and quarantine requirements if vaccinated.\\n“Businesses have lost a lot of money during this whole period here so there’s a lot to recoup,” Mufi Hannemann, president and chief executive of the Hawaii Tourism and Lodging Association, told local news station Hawaii News Now. “We’re anxious to get this economy moving forward in a safe and healthy manner.”\\nOn the flip side, a growing number of states are passing laws banning vaccine passports, citing concerns of privacy and intrusion on people’s decisions to get vaccinated.\\n“Government should not require any Texas to show proof of vaccination and reveal private health information just to go about their daily lives,” said Governor Greg Abbott, who ordered that no government agency or institution receiving government funding should require proof of vaccination.\\nThe governors of Mississippi, Florida, Tennessee, Arizona and Indiana have passed or voiced support for similar laws.\\nSplits have already taken place. Norwegian Cruise Line, for example, told the CDC it would be willing to require passengers be fully vaccinated before boarding, but Florida’s governor, Ron DeSantis, said his ban on vaccine passports prohibits such a mandate.\\nNova Southeastern University in Fort Lauderdale, like many colleges and universities, said they would require students to be vaccinated before returning to campus in the fall, but the school is considering backtracking the policy following DeSantis’s order.\\nThough conservative figures like Donald Trump Jr, who called vaccine passports “invasive”, have started to broadly attack Democrats for backing vaccine passports, the White House has made it clear the federal government has no plans to release a vaccine passport, or require mandatory vaccines.\\n“The government is not now nor will we be supporting a system that requires Americans to carry a credential,” said Jen Psaki, White House press secretary, earlier in April.\\nPsaki said the White House would release guidance for businesses and local governments who wish to implement vaccine passports.\\nVaccine passports have historically been used when crossing country borders. For example, some countries, including Ghana and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, require people to have the vaccine against yellow fever before entering their countries. And while vaccine passports have not been used widely domestically in the US, vaccine mandates, and the proof of vaccines needed to carry them out, are common. Many schools require students to get a host of vaccines, while many healthcare systems often require the annual flu vaccine for employers.\\nSensitivity around a vaccine passport is probably an offshoot of a broader vaccine hesitancy. Recent polling has shown that vaccine skepticism has a partisan bent: 30% of Republicans said they would not get the vaccine versus 11% of Democrats, according to the Covid States Project.\\nDavid Lazer, professor of political science at Northeastern University and a researcher with the Covid States Project, said “partisan divides on behaviors and policies have been acute throughout the pandemic”, but Democrats and Republicans are more evenly split on vaccines compared with other policies against Covid-19, like mask-wearing and social distancing.\\nThe term “passport” could also be turning people away from the concept, said Maureen Miller, an epidemiologist with Columbia University, as it implies that verification requires more personal information beyond vaccination status. A recent poll from the de Beaumont Foundation confirmed this, with Republican respondents being more supportive of vaccine “verification” over a “passport”.\\nMiller said the World Health Organization, which is developing its own Smart Vaccine Certificate and standards for vaccine verification programs, has been adamant about making the distinction between a certificate and a passport.\\n“A passport contains a lot of personal information, and a vaccine certificate does not,” Miller said. “It contains only the information necessary to convey the fact that the person has been vaccinated.”\\nOther groups including the Vaccine Credential Initiative and the Covid-19 Credential Initiative are working on coming up with standards for digital vaccine passports with the aim of building trust in vaccine verification programs.\\nMiller said the ultimate goal would be to reach herd immunity in the US, which would nix the need for vaccine passports but would require working through the skepticism that exists in the country.\\n“People are not going to feel comfortable in large numbers, in social environments until we hit a kind of herd immunity, where, when you bump into someone, the risk of an infectious person bumping into someone who’s susceptible is decreased tremendously,” Miller said.\\nThis article was amended on 30 April 2021.

What we have is probably all we have for the rest of the year.”\\nObservers have blamed factors including community mistrust in the Hong Kong and Chinese governments, disinformation and misinformation and a lack of urgency from authorities. In March the BioNtech rollout was suspended for about 10 days after the discovery of damaged packaging of vials which had been administered to more than 150,000 people. Health officials said there was no safety risk but the rollout was suspended as a precautionary measure, and two batches returned.\\nAccording to government figures, about 19% of Hongkongers have received their first dose, and 13.8% their second. About 56.5% of all doses administered are BioNtech.\\nThere has also been growing criticism of the government for blocking the refugee population from receiving vaccines.\\nThis week saw reports of hotels offering cash incentives to staff who took the vaccine, with bonuses of 70% of employees were vaccinated.\\nThe chief executive of Hong Kong, Carrie Lam, on Tuesday rejected suggestions the government should offer such incentives, but hoped the private sector would do more, saying it would also boost the economy.\\nOn Sunday Hong Kong’s secretary for the civil service said a higher rate of vaccines was crucial in determining future travel arrangements between Hong Kong and mainland China.\\nVaccine hesitancy has been an issue in several countries which have had relative success in controlling the spread of the virus, including Australia, Pacific and South east Asian nations, and Taiwan.\",\n",
       "  'Two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine have proved more than 95% effective against infection, hospitalisation and death from Covid-19 in Israel, the country with the highest proportion of its population vaccinated in the world, research has found.\\nOne shot of the vaccine was partially effective, offering 58% protection against infection, 76% against hospitalisation, and 77% against death. The authors of the observational study in the Lancet medical journal say this shows the importance of having the second shot.\\nTheir study demonstrates the power of vaccines to end the toll of coronavirus, they say. “These findings suggest that high vaccine uptake can meaningfully stem the pandemic and offers hope for eventual control of the Sars-CoV-2 outbreak as vaccination programmes ramp up across the rest of the world,” they wrote.\\nLead author, Dr Sharon Alroy-Preis, of the Israel ministry of health, said: “Until this point, no country in the world had described the national public health impact of a nationwide Covid-19 vaccination campaign. These insights are hugely important because, while there are still some considerable challenges to overcome, they offer real hope that Covid-19 vaccination will eventually enable us to control the pandemic.”\\nBut many other countries will not be able to imitate Israel, commentators in the journal say.\\n“Regrettably, rapid population-level coverage cannot be easily replicated in many other countries. The global use of the [Pfizer/BioNTech] vaccine is limited by supply issues, high costs, and ultra-cold chain storage requirements,” wrote Prof Eyal Leshem of the Chaim Sheba Medical Centre in Israel, and Prof Annelies Wilder-Smith of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, who were not involved in the study.\\nIsrael has used only the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, which the company supplied on the understanding that data from the vaccination programme would be published to demonstrate its real-world efficacy.\\nThe country had a national lockdown from 27 December 2020 until 7 March 2021 because of a big surge in infections, which peaked in January. By 3 April, 72% of adults over 16 and 90% of the over-65s had received two doses of the vaccine. As in the UK, the dominant strain of the virus has been the “Kent” variant, B117. Some cases of the “South African” variant, B1351, have been found latterly, but too few to be taken into account.\\nBy seven days after the second dose, the vaccine was giving people 95.3% protection against infection and 96∙7% protection against death. Protection against symptomatic and asymptomatic infection was 97.0% and 91.5%, respectively. Protection against hospital admission was 97.2% overall. By 14 days after the second dose, the protection had risen slightly further.\\nThe authors, some of whom declared shares in Pfizer, wrote that “relying on protection against Covid-19 from a single dose might not be prudent”. The vaccine was developed to be given as two shots and substantially higher levels of antibodies have been observed after the second dose.\\n“Additionally, little is known about the duration of protection of one dose and how it compares with the durability after two doses. It is possible that one dose will provide a shorter duration of protection than two doses, particularly in an environment where new Sars-CoV-2 variants continue to emerge,” they wrote.\\nIn a separate study published in the BMJ on Thursday, researchers from Denmark and Norway revealed their investigations into the blood clots that have been linked to the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine. They looked at 280,000 people aged 18-65 who received a first dose of the vaccine in the two countries in February and March.\\nThey found more clots in the veins than would be expected, although the events were still rare – 11 per 100,000 vaccinations. There were 2.5 clots in the veins of the brain per 100,000 jabs.\\nIn a linked opinion, Prof Paul Hunter at the University of East Anglia, said the study did not change the conclusions of the UK and European medicine regulators that the benefits of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine far outweigh its risks for most age groups.\\n“Those countries that delayed their own vaccination programmes at a time of high transmission rates by declining to use available Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccines should know that their decision will have contributed to an increase in the number of avoidable deaths from Covid-19,” he writes.',\n",

The NHS vaccine rollout began on 8 December 2020 when 90-year-old Margaret Keenan became the first person in the world to receive the jab as part of a mass vaccination programme. This is one of the cutting-edge mRNA vaccines that smuggles the genetic instructions for making the coronavirus spike protein into muscle cells. Coronavirus is covered in spike proteins, so making human cells manufacture it primes the immune system to attack the virus should it invade.\\nVolunteers sought for clinical trial of Covid vaccine made in Scotland\\nRead more\\nOxford/AstraZeneca\\nWith 100m doses on order, the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is a major pillar of the national immunisation programme. The first shot outside trials was given on 4 January 2021. The vaccine is based on a virus that causes common colds in chimps. The virus is engineered to ensure it cannot replicate in humans and modified further to include the genetic instructions to make the coronavirus spike protein.\\nNIH/Moderna\\nThe second mRNA vaccine to reach the market joined the country’s vaccination programme less than three weeks ago, on 7 April. The government has ordered 17m doses of the Moderna jab. In response to the very rare blood clots seen in some people who receive the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, people under 30 in the UK are offered Moderna or Pfizer shots instead.\\nNovavax\\nThe UK medicines regulator is expected to approve the Novavax vaccine imminently. It is known as a protein subunit vaccine and incorporates a lab-made coronavirus spike protein and an ingredient called an adjuvant that makes the body’s immune response stronger. The UK has ordered 60m doses. While Novavax is a US company, supplies for the mass vaccination programme will be made in Stockton-on-Tees with the final “fill and finish” step at GlaxoSmithKline’s plant in Barnard Castle, County Durham.\\nJanssen/Johnson & Johnson\\nThe UK medicines regulator is conducting a rolling review of the Janssen vaccine, which is based on similar “viral vector” technology to the Oxford/AstraZeneca shot. US health officials lifted a short pause in administering the Janssen vaccine on Saturday after deciding that the benefits outweighed the low risk of blood clots that resemble those seen in small numbers of people who received the Oxford/AstraZeneca shot. A major advantage of the Janssen vaccine is that it requires only one dose while the others need two. The UK vaccines taskforce has ordered 30m doses.\\nOthers\\nIf it performs well in final stage trials, Valneva’s vaccine, which uses an inactivated whole virus and an adjuvant to strengthen the immune response, could be approved for use as a booster this autumn.

       "  'I\\nmagine 100 people are ill with Covid-19. “90% efficacy” means if only they’d had the vaccine, on average only 10 would have got ill. Vaccine efficacy is the relative reduction in the risk: whatever your risk was before, it is reduced by 90% if you get vaccinated. There is a lot of confusion about this number: it does not mean there is a 10% chance of getting Covid-19 if vaccinated – that chance will be massively lower than 10%.\\nResearchers estimate efficacy by comparing numbers of new cases in vaccinated and unvaccinated people, best done through a “randomised control trial”. All volunteers receive an injection but, at random, either the actual vaccine or a placebo.They don’t know which they are getting.\\nIn the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine trial, there were eight cases in the 22,000 people who got the real vaccine. (So in the trial the risk of getting ill, if you were vaccinated, was only around 8/22,000 = 0.04%.) This compares with 162 cases in the 22,000 people who got the dummy vaccine. Researchers allocated people at random, so we can be sure the vaccine caused this difference. Since 8/162 = 5%, we estimate the efficacy of the vaccine as 95%, but there is some uncertainty around these estimates. The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine has an estimated efficacy of 70% for stopping symptomatic disease (30 v 101 cases).\\nDoctors call for shorter gap between Pfizer Covid vaccine doses in UK\\nRead more\\nThe trials were not about estimating efficacy in preventing severe disease and death. Limited data suggest efficacy may be even higher for these more serious outcomes. These efficacies hold from one or two weeks after two doses have been given. Based on additional data analysis and experience from previous vaccines, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation concluded that a single dose provides major protection and approved delaying the second dose up to 12 weeks. This is controversial and is the subject of urgent study.\\nIt remains uncertain how much vaccines reduce the risk of infections without symptoms, so people may still be able to spread the virus. The Oxford/AZ trials estimated 46% efficacy for preventing infection detected by a positive test, but this is being studied further. If you have received one dose, the best advice is to act as if you are not vaccinated.

       "  'A coalition of 156 countries has agreed a “landmark” deal to enable the rapid and equitable global distribution of any new coronavirus vaccines to 3% of participating countries’ populations, to protect vulnerable healthcare systems, frontline health workers and those in social care settings.\\nThe Covid-19 vaccine allocation plan – co-led by the World Health Organization and known as Covax – has been set up to ensure that the research, purchase and distribution of any new vaccine is shared equally between the world’s richest countries and those in the developing world.\\nSixty-four higher income economies have already joined Covax, which includes commitments from 35 economies as well as the European commission, which will procure doses on behalf of the 27 EU member states plus Norway and Iceland, with 38 more expected to join in the coming days.\\nUltimately the scheme aims to deliver 2bn doses of safe, effective vaccines around the world by the end of 2021.\\nGovernments, vaccine manufacturers, organisations and individuals have committed $1.4bn (£1.1bn) towards vaccine research and development so far.\\nRecognising that the first useful vaccines to emerge may be in short supply, approved vaccines will initially be made available to a tightly targeted 3% of the population of participating countries, building over time to 20% of each country’s most vulnerable population.\\nUnveiling the agreement at a briefing in Geneva on Monday, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, head of the UN health body, said Covax represented the “world’s largest and most diverse portfolio of Covid vaccines” in which the priority would be given to those most at risk.\\n“This is a mechanism that enables global coordination of the rollout for the greatest possible impact and will help bring the pandemic under control and ensure the race for vaccines is a collaboration not a contest,” he said.\\nHe added that the scheme would ensure vaccines for “some people in all countries and not all people in some countries”.\\nJust $5 per person a year could prevent future pandemic, says ex-WHO head\\nRead more\\nAccording to a document detailing the arrangement, under the scheme “all countries should gradually receive tranches [of vaccine] to cover each subset of their [initial] target groups … until they can cover 3% of the population”.\\nThe document continues: “At this point of the pandemic, a reasonable scenario would be that, while the supply of Covid-19 vaccines remains very scarce, countries should focus initially on reducing mortality and protecting the health system.\\n“This … would enable, for example, the vaccination of frontline workers in health and social care settings in most countries … Additional tranches will follow gradually as more supply becomes available.”\\nWhile decisions on the distribution of vaccines initially supplied under the scheme will remain at individual nations’ discretion, it said it was encouraging “countries to consider these recommendations and to be transparent about their decision-making processes and ultimate use of the vaccine”.\\nSet up to counter the increasing threat of so-called “vaccine nationalism” in the midst of the ongoing pandemic, Covax is being led by the WHO, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovations (Cepi) to ensure the “equitable access and allocation of Covid-19 health products”, not least vaccines.\\nGavi welcomed that Covax was “now in business”.\\n“Governments from every continent have chosen to work together, not only to secure vaccines for their own populations, but also to help ensure that vaccines are available to the most vulnerable everywhere,” said Dr Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi.\\n“With the commitments we’re announcing today for the Covax facility, as well as the historic partnership we are forging with industry, we now stand a far better chance of ending the acute phase of this pandemic once safe, effective vaccines become available.”\\nMeasles vaccination disruptions due to coronavirus put 80 million children at risk\\nRead more\\nDr Richard Hatchett, CEO of Cepi, said: “This is a landmark moment in the history of public health with the international community coming together to tackle this pandemic.\\n“The global spread of Covid-19 means that it is only through equitable and simultaneous access to new lifesaving Covid-19 vaccines that we can hope to end this pandemic.\\n“Countries coming together in this way shows a unity of purpose and resolve to end the acute phase of this pandemic, and we must now work closely with vaccine manufacturers – who play an integral part in the global response – to put in place the agreements needed to fulfil Covax’s core aim: to have 2bn vaccine doses available by the end of 2021. Today, we have taken a great leap towards that goal, for the benefit of all.”',\n",
       "  'T\\nhe global introduction of newly approved coronavirus vaccines has been marked by delays, shortages and bureaucratic errors as it has become clear that many governments will miss their targets for mass inoculation.\\nThe burst of optimism that arrived with approvals of new vaccines – encouraged by unrealistic expectations raised by politicians – is colliding with the reality of the challenge of vaccinating a large part of the world’s population.\\nThe vast scale of the effort by pharmaceutical companies to produce and package doses is already seeing strains through shortages of “fill and finish” materials such as the glass vials used for the vaccine.\\nOther chokepoints involve the capacity of regulatory authorities to approve packaged batches of vaccine, the effectiveness of national systems for vaccination, and local requirements for advising, monitoring and then logging the data of recipients, most of which is more time-consuming than giving the injection.\\nSo how are individual countries doing?\\nUnited States\\nThe US’s rollout of its vaccine programme has struggled, echoing the country’s chaotic response to the pandemic under Donald Trump.\\nOut of about 17.5m doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines that have been delivered around the country, only 4.2m have been administered, mainly comprising the first of two doses.\\nThat is far behind where the US planned to be at the end of 2020, when it had been hoped 20 million people would have been vaccinated. Reports have emerged of vaccines going bad due to poor organisation, lack of healthcare professionals to administer them or, in one case, sabotage.\\nThe US’s top public health official, Dr Anthony Fauci, prepares to receive a dose of the Moderna Covid vaccine. Photograph: Reuters\\nThe biggest issue in the delays appears to be the fact that federal officials left delivery logistics to local health officials and hospitals, even as they were struggling to deal with the impact of a pandemic that has killed more than 350,000 Americans.\\nThe US Food and Drugs Administration, however, has said it will not follow the UK and some other countries in giving as many people as possible a first dose of vaccine and extending the period to the second dose to speed up the process.\\nIsrael\\nHailed as a success story for the initial speed of its vaccination campaign, Israeli media reported last week that the pace of the vaccination campaign means it is running low on purchased doses and may have to pause unless a new supply is negotiated.\\nPeople receive coronavirus vaccines in Ramat Gan, Israel. Photograph: Oded Balilty/AP\\nWhile Israel’s vaccination campaign – which has relied on the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine that needs to be stored at ultra-cold temperatures – has been among the fastest in the world, its health minister, Yuli Edelstein, said his ministry may stop administering first doses for a short period, telling Channel 12 “there will be no shortage of the second dose”.This week saw Israel also approve the Moderna vaccine, although doses may not be widely available for two months.\\nEuropean Union\\nA disconnect between different regulatory approval regimes for vaccines is also causing its own issues, not least a shortage of supplies in some countries. While the UK quickly approved the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for emergency use in the UK and has since approved a second, the European Medicines Agency adopted a slower regulatory process and with Pfizer/BioNTech so far the only vaccine permitted within the bloc it has led to more demand from EU countries than the company can yet deliver.\\nIt has warned there will be gaps in the supply of its vaccines until other vaccines are rolled out, with Uğur Şahin, the BioNTech chief executive, telling Germany’s Spiegel: “At the moment it doesn’t look good – a hole is appearing because there’s a lack of other approved vaccines and we have to fill the gap with our own vaccine.”\\nA nurse holds a Covid vaccine in Rome, Italy. Photograph: Massimo Percossi/EPA\\nThe European commission said on Monday it was in discussions with Pfizer and BioNTech about the possibility of ordering more doses of their vaccine, in addition to the 300m shots already covered under an existing contract. It was not clear whether this would compete with a German deal for more doses of the same vaccine.\\nUnderlining the problem of vaccine supply, Germany and Denmark are also looking into the possibility of delaying administering a second dose of the vaccine to make scarce supplies go further, after a similar move by Britain last week.\\nFrance\\nWithin the EU, France has had its own specific issues that have meant its vaccination programme has progressed at a glacial pace so far.\\nWith one of the world’s most vaccine-sceptical populations, France had by the weekend only managed to inoculate 516 people compared with the UK’s 1 million, despite having 500,000 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.\\nA patient receives a Covid vaccine at the Hôtel-Dieu hospital in Paris. Photograph: Sameer Al-Doumy/AFP/Getty Images\\nCritics have also pointed to the 200,000 people who have been immunised in Germany during a similar timeframe after the EU-wide rollout began a week ago. The figure in France rose to several thousand on Monday, according to the health minister, Olivier Véran.\\nWith a “hypercritical” public attitude towards vaccines – a survey at the weekend showed six out of 10 people intended to refuse one – France had settled on a slow and bureaucratic process, including a mandatory consultation with a doctor several days before receiving a jab. The president, Emmanuel Macron, has demanded a quicker rollout.\\nFollowing criticism, the French health minister Olivier Véran announced on Tuesday plans to speed up the process including online registration and the administration of the vaccine by qualified health workers under the supervision of a doctor.\\nIndia\\nOne assumed advantage in national vaccination programmes is the presence of a well-developed manufacturing capacity, although that has not necessarily been the case in the US.\\nWhile Indian regulators have only just approved the country’s first two Covid vaccines for restricted emergency use, one developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University, and the other conceived locally by Bharat Biotech, India is home to the Serum Institute of India, the world’s largest manufacturer of vaccines that will eventually provide doses for the Covax scheme to supply the developing world.\\nPeople await for their turn during a trial at a Covid vaccination centre in New Delhi, India. Photograph: Altaf Qadri/AP\\nFor now, however, India’s emergency use authorisation means the vaccines will only be manufactured and made available in India, which with about 10m Covid-19 infections is one of the world’s worst-affected countries behind the US. Brazil is in talks to secure doses from India before a possible export ban.\\nThe country plans to inoculate 300 million frontline workers, elderly and vulnerable people out of its population of 1.35 billion by August and has a stockpile of more than 50m doses. India also has considerable experience in running mass vaccination campaigns.\\nChina\\nChina, where Covid-19 originated, has (like Russia) pursued a typically aggressive approach to vaccine development and inoculation that has raised eyebrows in the west over claims of a lack of transparency in testing data.\\nFour and a half million Chinese received doses of Chinese made vaccines under trial even before the approval last week of a vaccine produced by the state-owned Sinopharm company, with Beijing alone setting up 220 pop-up vaccination sites and delivering more than 73,000 shots in the first two days of 2021.\\nPeople are inoculated with a Covid vaccine at a healthcare centre in Beijing.

Experts have said the absence of effective vaccination in the developing world could leave reservoirs of disease, including new mutations, that will continue to threaten global outbreaks.',\n",
       "  'More than 1 billion people could be immunised against coronavirus by the end of next year with shots from the first two companies to reveal positive results, after the latest vaccine was shown in trials to have an efficacy of nearly 95% .\\nWith the US’s top infectious diseases official, Anthony Fauci, hailing “the light at the end of the tunnel”, the US biotech firm Moderna announced impressive results for its mRNA vaccine on Monday, a week after interim results for a Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine showed 90% efficacy.\\nThe inclusion of high-risk and elderly people in the Moderna trial suggested the vaccine would protect those most vulnerable to the disease, said Peter Openshaw, a professor of experimental medicine at Imperial College London, who described the results as “tremendously exciting”.\\nThough it is more expensive, Moderna’s vaccine could potentially provide a major advantage over Pfizer’s, which requires ultracold freezing between -70C (-94F) and -80C from production facility to patient.\\nModerna said it had improved the shelf life and stability, meaning its vaccine can be stored for six months at -20C for shipping and long-term storage, and at standard refrigeration temperatures of 2C to 8C for 30 days.\\nModerna said it could potentially manufacture 1bn doses by the end of 2021, adding to a further 1.3bn from Pfizer/BioNTech in the same timeframe. Both vaccines require two doses and are due to be assessed by regulators in coming weeks.\\nSpeaking at a press briefing, Fauci, the director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which co-developed the vaccine, lauded the Moderna jab and others still in trials.\\nHe urged people to continue to observe guidelines to combat the disease. “We should not let the accomplishment of an effective vaccine have us feel we can let our guard down … In fact, it should be an incentive to double down as we then ultimately have the synergy between a vaccine and a public health measure which will get us out of the very difficult situation.”\\nStéphane Bancel, the chief executive of Moderna, said: “This has been incredible teamwork. I think none of us probably thought that we could get to this place in the last 10 months.”\\nModerna’s interim analysis, based on the first 95 patients with confirmed Covid infections, found the candidate vaccine had an efficacy of 94.5%. The company said it planned to apply to the US regulator, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), for emergency use authorisation in the coming weeks. In the analysis, 90 of the patients had received the placebo with the remaining five getting the vaccine.\\nHere are the major hurdles ahead for Covid-19 vaccine distribution in the US\\nRead more\\nThough provisional, the results are particularly exciting because the trial included a large proportion of people at high risk of severe Covid-19 and these appear to have been well protected.\\nThe Moderna vaccine, which is being trialled in more than 30,000 volunteers, is not expected to be available outside the US until next year. The biotech company said it would have 20m doses ready to ship in the US before the end of 2020 and hoped to manufacture 500m to 1bn doses globally next year.\\nModerna has agreed to provide the US with 100m doses, with an option to buy 400m more. Japan, Canada, Switzerland, Qatar and Israel have also signed agreements, and the European commission has a “potential purchase agreement” for 80m-160m doses.\\nThe vaccine, which is based on similar mRNA technology to BioNTech’s, is expected to be assessed by the FDA on a final analysis of 151 Covid cases among trial participants who will be followed on average for more than two months.\\nAt £38 to £45 for a course of two shots, Moderna’s vaccine is more expensive than the other frontrunners. AstraZeneca and Oxford University are aiming to sell their vaccine at about £3 a dose, while vaccines in trial with Johnson & Johnson and a collaboration between Sanofi and GSK are both expected to cost about £8 a dose. Pfizer is charging the US about £30 for a two-shot course.\\nModerna’s two-shot vaccine injects genetic material called mRNA into the body, which cells then use to churn out the spike protein the virus uses to invade cells. The spike protein covers the surface of the virus and is one of the main targets of the body’s immune response to wipe out the infection.\\nCovid vaccine tracker: when will a coronavirus vaccine be ready?\\nRead more\\nThere is some statistical uncertainty over the 94.5% figure but Stephen Evans, a professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said that based on the numbers released, the efficacy was still likely to be better than 85%.\\nA question mark remains over whether the Pfizer vaccine prevents serious illness. The Moderna results, released by an independent data safety monitoring board, are encouraging on this point.\\nOf 11 participants who developed severe Covid while on the trial, all were in the placebo group. The results also suggest the vaccine is effective in older people and those from diverse ethnic backgrounds. Moderna said about 42% of participants were at risk of severe Covid-19 if infected, as they were older or had co-morbidities such as diabetes, obesity or high blood pressure.\\nModerna’s interim analysis found no significant safety concerns, with most reactions being mild to moderate and short lived. Among the side-effects reported were injection site pain in 2.7% of trial volunteers after the first jab. After the second, the most significant side-effects included fatigue in 9.7%, muscle pain in 9% and joint pain in 5%. Others had headaches, other pains, or redness at the injection site.\\nThis article was amended on 17 November 2020 to clarify that results of vaccine trials at this stage refer to “efficacy” – the performance of an intervention under ideal and controlled circumstances – not “effectiveness”, which describes performance under real-world conditions.',\n",

       "  'A coronavirus “vaccination persuasion” initiative targeting elderly people who have declined invitations to get vaccinated is gearing up to be rolled out across Turkey after proving a resounding success in a district in the country’s south-east.\\nSince February, doctors and healthcare workers in the mainly Kurdish city of Adıyaman, or Semsûr, have been calling people in age groups already eligible for the vaccine to ask why they have not come to clinics for appointments.\\nThen, equipped with cooler boxes full of vaccine vials, and occasionally accompanied by muhtars, or community leaders, they fan out across the rural area to visit patients who are still reluctant.\\nThe theory is that a face-to-face conversation will help change people’s minds. It is working, boosting the vaccine take-up rate among the 250,000 strong population scattered across the province’s central district by nearly 30%, according to Dr Hülya Doğan Tiryaki.\\n“The teams are advised to use calming language and logical arguments over the phone. About half of the people we call then tell us they will come to a clinic for their vaccination,” she said.\\nNusret Uncu (left) and Dr Ahmet Ozbek gear up for a day of door-to-door ‘vaccination persuasion’.

Having community leaders come with us helps a lot: they know the families we visit, and open up a channel of trust.”\\nWhile Ankara aims to have vaccinated everyone over the age of 40 against Covid-19 by the end of June, according to the latest available figures from the health ministry, vaccine scepticism in Turkey is high: 23.6% of over-65s have decided not to get inoculated, as well as 14% of healthcare workers.\\nDuring a home visit last week, 66-year-old Fatma Gultekin looked worried when her muhtar, a doctor and a health ministry worker showed up at the house.\\nSeveral calls from the family doctor had not convinced Gultekin of the merits of vaccination. But after the team reassured her that an injection would offer protection if she contracted the virus, and promised to wait with her in case of any side-effects, she rolled up her sleeve.\\n“Did it hurt?” 11-year-old Hira asked, hugging her grandmother afterwards. “No,” she replied.\\nMany people the persuasion teams encounter appear to be hesitant to get vaccinated because of fears it will affect other health problems such as diabetes, blood pressure and fertility, said Dr İbrahim Kaygusuz.\\n“I think sometimes people say that to cover up their fear of the unknown,” he said. “My own grandmother, who is 76, told me she was afraid of becoming barren if she got the vaccination … I told her that’s not the case, and besides, she doesn’t need another baby!”\\nSometimes muhtars get creative, he said, offering vouchers or gift cards to reluctant people.\\n“More than one person has asked: ‘What about my other arm?’ when they realise there are incentives like that,” Kaygusuz added.\\nIn Kuyulu, a village surrounded by fields of pistachios and lentils 27 miles (45km) away from Adıyaman city, 57-year-old Yusuf Erol said his mother had died from coronavirus, but he was worried inoculation would affect his blood pressure: his wife, Naile, 50, said she had heard it would interfere with Ramadan fasting.\\nAfter 10 minutes of talking with the persuasion team, they both decided to get vaccinated.\\n“They came all this way to talk to us,” Erol said. “I am thankful to them for their time.”\\nAdıyaman’s persuasion campaign got under way thanks to early efforts from the local health authority and governor’s office, which sought approval from the health ministry.\\nMarried couple Yusuf Erol, 57, and Naile Erol, 50, in the village of Kuyulu. The couple took the vaccine after being visited by health workers. Photograph: Gokce Saracoglu\\nThe health minister, Fahrettin Koca, said this month the strategy would be rolled out nationwide, although no dates have yet been given. Antalya province, on the Mediterranean, began a similar campaign last week.\\nTurkey implemented a third nationwide partial lockdown at the beginning of Ramadan, around the same time new cases of coronavirus shot up to record highs of more than 63,000 a day. After Monday night’s cabinet meeting, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan announced Turkey’s first total lockdown, which will run until after the Bayram (Eid) holiday, in order “not to be left behind” as Europe prepares to reopen.\\nTurkey is now using the Sinovac, Pfizer and Sputnik vaccines as part of its vaccination programme and is working on a domestic product. Temperature and other storage restrictions mean that for now the persuasion teams can only carry Sinovac, which may not be as effective as other vaccines in preventing serious infection.\\nThat did not stop Hatice Yalcin, 66, from rushing over to get her shot when the healthcare team came to visit her neighbour.\\n“I was sick when they called me to come for the vaccination the first time,” she said. “You will all go to heaven for this good work.”',\n",
       "  \"“T\\noday it is easier to get a nuclear weapon than to get a vaccine,” the Serbian president, Aleksandar Vučić, declared in January. He was bragging. The Balkans country had just received its first shipment of almost 1m Covid-19 vaccine doses from Sinopharm, a state-owned Chinese pharmaceutical company.\\nSince then, Serbia has augmented its stockpile with tens of thousands of shots of Russia’s Sputnik V, signed an agreement to build a bottling plant for the Russian vaccine and now boasts the fastest vaccination rate in continental Europe.\\nEuropean countries seeing public resistance to AstraZeneca vaccine – as it happened\\nRead more\\nBelgrade is flush enough that is has started practising its own vaccine diplomacy, giving thousands of doses to neighbouring North Macedonia, with others in its orbit such Montenegro and Republika Srpska expecting to receive donations soon.\\nAs the race to administer Covid-19 inoculations has ramped up this year, so have efforts to use the vaccines as instruments of influence. India entered the fray in February by giving away millions of doses to its neighbours in south Asia, where it has been competing for diplomatic sway with China. Beijing has announced a flurry of free doses over recent weeks to 13 countries, and say it plans to provide vaccines to 38 more. Moscow has capitalised on delays in the EU’s programme to sell its own vaccine to Hungary – even though the Russian formulation still awaits the bloc’s regulatory approval.\\nIn a market of extreme scarcity, with vaccination yet to begin in 130 countries, states such as Serbia are emerging as early leaders in the vaccination race, leveraging geopolitical competition – along with a willingness to smooth out regulatory hurdles – to access millions of doses fast.\\n“Vaccine procurement is symbolic of Serbia’s foreign policy strategy,” said Vuk Vuksanovic, a researcher at the London School of Economics and the Belgrade Centre for Security Policy. “Balance and pit the west against non-western powers like Russia and China, to see from which side you will score a better bargain.”\\nConspicuously missing so far from the fray of overseas deals and donations have been western governments, which are consumed with vaccinating their own populations first and have preferred to channel vaccine aid into multilateral schemes such as Covax, the sharing mechanism that will start by supplying about 3% of the most vulnerable people in middle- and lower-income countries over the next six months.\\nBy then, countries such as the UK, US and Canada expect to be on their way to herd immunity, along with a clutch of other wealthy countries that have bought up most of the supply of western vaccines that will be produced in 2021. The divide is a diplomatic opportunity, and some foreign capitals are taking it.\\n“The vaccine nationalism of western countries created the space for these other countries to practise vaccine diplomacy,” said Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations thinktank.\\nWhile China sent its Serbian ambassador to the airport ceremony marking the arrival of Sinopharm doses, and Vladimir Putin uses diplomatic summits to hawk Sputnik V, Washington, London and European capitals have preferred to let pharmaceutical companies take the spotlight, and largely allowed them to decide where vaccines go and in what quantities. With the exception of AstraZeneca, most have supplied the bulk of their doses so far to the highest bidders.\\n“Pfizer, Moderna too, they’re here to make a profit,” said Agathe Demarais, global forecasting director at the Economist Intelligence Unit. “Companies do not do diplomacy, in theory. They have short-term goals. So it’s very different when a vaccine is marketed by a government over a company.”\\nAn illustration of the difference is the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine made by the Serum Institute of India that Delhi gifted to governments in south Asia this month. The formulation was developed by a British university, in collaboration with a UK-Swedish company, but went out prominently branded: “Gift from the people and government of India.”\\nAny quid pro quo for vaccine aid is not likely to be immediate, analysts say. “Obviously Russia and China are not entering emerging countries saying you need to give us something back,” said Demarais. “But in the long term it will pay dividends. And the Russian and Chinese leaderships understand the pandemic is going to be with us for a long time to come.”\\nChina specialists are pointing to the way it has rolled vaccines into its belt and road initiative framework, using summits with Middle East and African countries to offer preferential access to jabs alongside investments in highways, ports, 5G grids and renewable energy. Last year, while Washington was trumpeting an “America first” response to the pandemic, Beijing was making high-profile deals to trial, produce and sell vaccines in Latin America, deep inside the US’s traditional sphere of influence.\\nA health worker shows a dose of the Chinese Sinopharm Covid-19 vaccine at a vaccination centre in the Jordanian capital Amman. Photograph: Khalil Mazraawi/AFP/Getty Images\\nIn a century likely to see several more pandemics, Covid-19 vaccines are providing a foothold for countries’ wider health industries. Jordan, a close US ally in the Middle East, has for decades sourced most of its routine vaccines from US companies. But with Sinopharm’s formulation forming the backbone of its Covid-19 vaccination programme, health experts in Jordan say they are having a fresh look at Chinese medical products across the board.\\n“From now on we’ll look favourably if a Chinese company comes and says: we have a good vaccine for diphtheria or polio or hepatitis,” said Najwa Khoury-Boulos, a distinguished professor of infectious diseases, who advises the government on the pandemic. “We may not change what we buy, but we’d look at it with more respect than before.”\\nRussian and Chinese companies have also been more willing than their western counterparts to strike licensing deals to allow manufacturers in places such as Indonesia, the United Arab Emirates and Malaysia, to partly or fully produce Covid-19 vaccines themselves. Last week the World Health Organizaton and Unicef put out a statement pleading for western companies to make more such deals, which may mean less profit in the long term but more vaccines sooner for societies that badly want them.\\nWorld's poor need action, not Covid 'vaccine nationalism', say experts\\nRead more\\nFor public health activists such as Achal Prabhala, the diplomatic machinations of such deals are beside the point. With relatively unambitious domestic vaccination targets compared with the west, Russia and China have the capacity to export lifesaving vaccines in the middle of an acute pandemic – and are doing so.\\n“Whatever the Russian and Chinese motives are for doing this, I don’t know and don’t necessarily care,” said Prabhala, a fellow of the Shuttleworth Foundation. “If the vaccines work and are affordable and available and they’re being aggressively pushed to countries who are happy to take them – who cares if it burnishes China’s image or softens Russia’s in the world?”\",\n",
       "  'Nearly 15% of health service workers in England remain unvaccinated, and the numbers coming forward for a jab have decreased sharply in the last two weeks, NHS figures have revealed, prompting concerns that many frontline staff are refusing the vaccine.\\nBut health leaders, patients’ groups and unions have been quick to dismiss any suggestion of mandatory vaccinations after it emerged that Matt Hancock, the health secretary, had embarked on a plan before the pandemic to make flu vaccinations compulsory for NHS staff.\\nLast week, the government began a consultation on whether or not to mandate vaccinations for care-home workers, and a London NHS trust discussed making the vaccination a condition of employment.\\nThe latest figures show that only 6,259 NHS staff in England had their first dose in the seven days before 11 April, down from 11,483 the previous week and substantially lower than the average of 22,985 per week during March. Now 190,697 workers out of 1,378,502 directly employed by the NHS remain unprotected against the coronavirus, four months after they became eligible for vaccination. The figures do not include agency workers, and will include some under-45s who are not frontline staff and are still waiting their turn.\\nSome NHS trusts would like to introduce mandatory vaccination because they believe efforts to persuade remaining staff are a distraction from other important tasks such as tackling the enormous waiting lists that have grown during the lockdowns.\\nLesley Watts, the chief executive of Chelsea and Westminster hospital foundation trust, wrote to other NHS trusts with a draft letter to staff saying Covid vaccination would be mandatory. After the letter was leaked, Watts said there was “no intention to mandate vaccination of our staff”, but did not explain why the letter was written or distributed.\\nHancock was a strident critic of anti-vaxxer movements before the pandemic, and told a fringe meeting at the Conservative party conference in 2019 that he favoured making vaccinations compulsory for all childhood diseases. He then asked civil servants at the Department of Health and Social Care to work out how to make flu vaccines mandatory for NHS staff. The DHSC did not say if the proposal was still being considered.\\nOpponents of mandatory vaccination believe it could be counterproductive and cause vaccination rates to fall in the future. If a vaccine is mandatory, it is harder for people to voice concerns they may have, and there are fewer opportunities to persuade them to get inoculated.\\nNorth Middlesex University hospital trust has drawn up 32 reasons for hesitancy and matched them to clinical advice so that staff can easily find evidence to help counter any concerns.\\nSaffron Cordery, the deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, said the issue was “incredibly complex” and that the consultation on social care had “inevitably put the spotlight on whether a similar policy should be introduced in the health service or other parts of social care.\\nHow many anti-vaxxers does it take to misinform the world? Just twelve\\nArwa Mahdawi\\nRead more\\n“Mandatory vaccinations raise a number of legal and ethical questions and, as expected, there is a wide and diverse range of views on this among trust leaders,” she said. “While we are pleased with the strong uptake of the Covid-19 vaccine among staff groups so far, we know more needs to be done to address vaccine hesitancy within the workforce and throughout society.” One-to-one conversations had been particularly effective, she added.\\nDame Donna Kinnair, the general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said compulsion might affect future vaccination programmes. Unison’s general secretary, Christina McAnea, said: “Forcing NHS staff to have the Covid vaccine would be premature and counterproductive. Work must be done to understand and address the concerns of hesitant staff. A heavy-handed approach could stoke resentment and further erode morale, already near rock-bottom after the government’s insulting 1% pay rise recommendation.”\\nThe NHS said: “The vaccination programme has successfully vaccinated 19 out 20 people aged 50 and over as well as nearly nine in 10 NHS staff.

That’s why the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said the UK was “throwing everything at it”.\\nBut while trials have been launched and manufacturing deals already signed – Oxford University is now recruiting 10,000 volunteers for the next phase of its research – ministers and their advisers have become noticeably more cautious in recent days.\\nThis is why.\\nWhy might a vaccine fail?\\nEarlier this week, England’s deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam said the words nobody wanted to hear: “We can’t be sure we will get a vaccine.”\\nBut he was right to be circumspect.\\nVaccines are simple in principle but complex in practice. The ideal vaccine protects against infection, prevents its spread, and does so safely. But none of this is easily achieved, as vaccine timelines show.\\nMore than 30 years after scientists isolated HIV, the virus that causes Aids, we have no vaccine. The dengue fever virus was identified in 1943, but the first vaccine was approved only last year, and even then amid concerns it made the infection worse in some people. The fastest vaccine ever developed was for mumps. It took four years.\\nScientists have worked on coronavirus vaccines before, so are not starting from scratch. Two coronaviruses have caused lethal outbreaks before, namely Sars and Mers, and vaccine research went ahead for both. But none have been licensed, partly because Sars fizzled out and Mers is regional to the Middle East. The lessons learned will help scientists create a vaccine for Sars-CoV-2, but there is still an awful lot to learn about the virus.\\nA chief concern is that coronaviruses do not tend to trigger long-lasting immunity. About a quarter of common colds are caused by human coronaviruses, but the immune response fades so rapidly that people can become reinfected the next year.\\nResearchers at Oxford University recently analysed blood from recovered Covid-19 patients and found that levels of IgG antibodies – those responsible for longer-lasting immunity – rose steeply in the first month of infection but then began to fall again.\\nLast week, scientists at Rockefeller University in New York found that most people who recovered from Covid-19 without going into hospital did not make many killer antibodies against the virus.\\n“That’s what is particularly challenging,” says Stanley Perlman, a veteran coronavirus researcher at the University of Iowa. “If the natural infection doesn’t give you that much immunity except when it’s a severe infection, what will a vaccine do? It could be better, but we don’t know.” If a vaccine only protects for a year, the virus will be with us for some time.\\nThe genetic stability of the virus matters too. Some viruses, such as influenza, mutate so rapidly that vaccine developers have to release new formulations each year. The rapid evolution of HIV is a major reason we have no vaccine for the disease.\\nSo far, the Sars-CoV-2 coronavirus seems fairly stable, but it is acquiring mutations, as all viruses do. Some genetic changes have been spotted in the virus’s protein “spikes” which are the basis of most vaccines. If the spike protein mutates too much, the antibodies produced by a vaccine will effectively be out of date and might not bind the virus effectively enough to prevent infection.\\nMartin Hibberd, professor of emerging infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who helped identify some of the virus’s mutations, called them “an early warning”.\\nAnother challenge: making any vaccine safe\\nIn the rush to develop a vaccine – there are now more than 100 in development – safety must remain a priority. Unlike experimental drugs for the severely ill, the vaccine will be given to potentially billions of generally healthy people.\\nThis means scientists will have to check extremely carefully for signs of dangerous side-effects. During the search for a Sars vaccine in 2004, scientists found that one candidate caused hepatitis in ferrets. Another serious concern is “antibody-induced enhancement” where the antibodies produced by a vaccine actually make future infections worse. The effect caused serious lung damage in animals given experimental vaccines for both Sars and Mers.\\nJohn McCauley, director of the Worldwide Influenza Centre at the Francis Crick Institute, says it takes time to understand the particular challenges each vaccine throws up. “You don’t know the difficulties, the specific difficulties, that every vaccine will give you,” he says. “And we haven’t got experience in handling this virus or the components of the virus.”\\nWe should ‘end up with something’ … but what does that mean?\\nWhen the prime minister, Boris Johnson, told a No 10 press briefing that a vaccine was “by no means guaranteed”, his chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, agreed, but added: “I’d be surprised if we didn’t end up with something.” Many scientists share that view.\\nIn all likelihood, a coronavirus vaccine will not be 100% effective.\\nThose in development draw on at least eight different approaches, from weakened and inactivated viruses to technologies that smuggle genetic code into the recipient’s cells, which then churn out spike proteins for the immune system to make antibodies against.\\nIdeally, a vaccine will generate persistent, high levels of antibodies to wipe out the virus and also “T” cells to destroy infected cells. But each vaccine is different and today no one knows what kind of immune response is good enough.\\n“We don’t even know if a vaccine can produce an immune response which would protect against future infection,” says David Heymann, who led the response of the World Health Organization (WHO) to the Sars epidemic.\\nEarly results from two frontrunner vaccines suggest they might have some use.\\nThe US biotech firm Moderna reported antibody levels similar to those found in recovered patients in 25 people who received its vaccine.\\nAnother vaccine from Oxford University did not stop monkeys contracting the virus, but did appear to prevent pneumonia, a major cause of death in coronavirus patients.\\nIf humans react the same way, vaccinated people would still spread the virus, but be less likely to die from it.\\nHow well a vaccine works determines how it is used. Armed with a highly effective vaccine that protects for several years, countries could aim for herd immunity by protecting at least two-thirds of the population.\\nCoronavirus patients pass the virus on to three others, on average, but if two or more are immune, the outbreak will fizzle out. That is the best-case scenario.\\nMore likely is we will end up with a vaccine, or a number of vaccines, that are only partially effective.\\nVaccines that contain weakened strains of virus can be dangerous for older people, but might be given to younger people with more robust immune systems to reduce the spread of infection.\\nMeanwhile, older people might get vaccines that simply prevent infections progressing to life-threatening pneumonia. “If you don’t have the ability to induce immunity, you’ve got to develop a strategy for reducing serious outcomes of infection,” says McCauley.\\nBut partially effective vaccines have their own problems: a vaccine that doesn’t stop the virus replicating can encourage resistant strains to evolve, making the vaccine redundant.\\nSo, is the virus here to stay?\\nThe simple answer is: yes.\\nHopes for eliminating the virus start with a vaccine but do not end there. “If and when we have a vaccine, what you get is not rainbows and unicorns,” says Larry Brilliant, CEO of Pandefense Advisory, who worked on the WHO’s smallpox eradication programme. “If we are forced to choose a vaccine that gives only one year of protection, then we are doomed to have Covid become endemic, an infection that is always with us.”\\nThe virus will still be tough to conquer with a vaccine that lasts for years.\\n“It will be harder to get rid of Covid than smallpox,” says Brilliant. With smallpox it was at least clear who was infected, whereas people with coronavirus can spread it without knowing. A thornier problem is that as long as the infection rages in one country, all other nations are at risk.\\nAs David Salisbury, the former director of immunisation at the Department of Health, told a Chatham House webinar recently: “Unless we have a vaccine available in unbelievable quantities that could be administered extraordinarily quickly in all communities in the world we will have gaps in our defences that the virus can continue to circulate in.”\\nOr as Brilliant puts it, the virus will “ping-pong back and forth in time and geography”.\\nOne proposal from Gavi, the vaccine alliance, is to boost the availability of vaccines around the world through an “advance market commitment”. And Brilliant believes some kind of global agreement must be hammered out now. “We should be demanding, now, a global conference on what we’re going to do when we get a vaccine, or if we don’t,” he says.\\n“If the process of getting a vaccine, testing it, proving it, manufacturing it, planning for its delivery, and building a vaccine programme all over the world, if that’s going to take as long as we think, then let’s fucking start planning it now.”\\nHow will we live with the virus?\\nPeople will have to adapt – and life will change. Heymann says we will have to get used to extensive monitoring for infections backed up by swift outbreak containment. People must play their part too, by maintaining handwashing, physical distancing and avoiding gatherings, particularly in enclosed spaces. Repurposed drugs are faster to test than vaccines, so we may have an antiviral or an antibody treatment that works before a vaccine is available, he adds. Immediate treatment when symptoms come on could at least reduce the death rate.\\nYuen Kwok-yung, a professor of infectious disease at the University of Hong Kong, has advised his government that all social distancing can be relaxed – but only if people wear masks in enclosed spaces such as on trains and at work, and that no food or drink are consumed at concerts and cinemas.\\nAt restaurants, tables will have to be shielded from each other and serving staff will follow strict rules to prevent spreading the virus. “In our Hong Kong perspective, the diligent and correct use of reusable masks is the most important measure,” he says.\\nSarita Jane Robinson, a psychologist who studies responses to threats at the University of Central Lancashire, says people are still adapting to the “new normal” and that without more interventions – such as fines for not wearing face masks – “we could see people drifting back to old behaviours”.\\nWe might become blase about Covid-19 deaths when life resumes and the media move on, but the seriousness of the illness will make it harder to ignore, she says.\\nHas the coronavirus pandemic made us all nicer?\\nRead more\\nOne last possibility could save a lot of trouble. Some scientists wonder whether the common cold coronaviruses crossed into humans in the distant past and caused similar illness before settling down. “If the virus doesn’t change there’s no reason to think that miraculously in five years’ time it won’t still cause pneumonia,” says Perlman. “But that’s the hope: that we end up with a much more mild disease and you only get a bad cold from it.”\\nHeymann says it is too soon to know how the pandemic will pan out. “We don’t understand the destiny of this virus,” he says. “Will it continue to circulate after its first pandemic? Or will it, like some other pandemic viruses, disappear or become less virulent? That we do not know.”\\nThis article was amended on 1 June 2020 because Larry Brilliant worked on the WHO’s smallpox eradication programme, but did not lead it as an earlier version said.',\n",

As of this week, all American adults are eligible to receive a vaccine. “To put it simply, if you’ve been waiting for your turn, wait no longer,” Biden said.\\nThe president initially promised to administer 100m doses over his first 100 days, but he doubled that goal after hitting 100m shots last month, weeks ahead of schedule.\\nMore than 80% of Americans over the age of 65 will have received at least one coronavirus vaccine dose by tomorrow, Biden said from the White House.\\nThe president said the country was “entering a new phase” in its vaccination efforts, now that all American adults are eligible.\\n“Now our objective is to reach everyone – everyone over the age of 16 in America,” Biden said. He also announced a new federal program to provide American workers with paid leave when they receive their coronavirus vaccinations.\\n“No working American should lose a single dollar from their paycheck because they chose to fulfill their patriotic duty of getting vaccinated,” the president said.\\nWith more than 50% of adults at least partially vaccinated and roughly 28m vaccine doses being delivered each week, supply has become less of a concern than demand.\\nIn a speech on Wednesday, Biden acknowledged entering a “new phase” in the federal vaccination effort that relies on increased outreach to Americans to get their shots, to protect themselves and their communities.\\n“Vaccines can save your own life, but they can also save your grandmother’s life, your co-worker’s life, the grocery store clerk or the delivery person helping you and your neighbors get through the crisis,” Biden said. “That’s why you should get vaccinated.”\\nEchoing public health experts, Biden reiterated that vaccines were the country’s way out of the pandemic.\\nBiden announces the US has reached 200m vaccine shots, in Washington.

That is partly a reflection of disruptions from the “pause” in administration of the Johnson & Johnson shot for a safety review after the vaccine was potentially linked to rare blood clot cases.\\nInspection finds peeling walls and residue at US plant that ruined 15m Johnson & Johnson vaccine doses\\nRead more\\nThere has also been a softening of interest in vaccines in many places even as eligibility has been opened to all. Surveys have shown that vaccine hesitancy has declined since the rollout of the shots, but administration officials believe they have to make getting vaccinated easier and more appealing, particularly for younger Americans who are less at risk from the virus and do not feel the same urgency to get a shot.\\nRoughly 130 million Americans have yet to receive one dose. And even as Biden celebrated the vaccine milestone, many states are seeing demand slip.\\nIn Iowa, nearly half of the counties are not accepting new doses of the Covid-19 vaccine from the state’s allotment because demand has fallen off. In Florida, Palm Beach county plans to close mass vaccination clinics at the end of May with thousands of available vaccine slots unclaimed. In rural West Virginia, a vaccine clinic at a casino/race track parking garage is opening shots to out-of-state residents to address lagging demand. The hope is that people from Washington DC make the hour’s drive to get vaccinated. In Arizona, a plan collapsed that would have opened a federally run vaccine site in Tucson; demand is slipping and county officials preferred more targeted, mobile locations.\\nAsked about the dip in vaccinations, Biden’s health secretary, Xavier Becerra, said “fluctuation is not uncommon” and that “what we want to do is continue to encourage Americans to continue to get vaccinated”.\\n“The pace of vaccination isn’t linear,” Becerra said, adding: “We are on a pretty good pace.”',\n",

The Guardian understands that talks among European countries over building a “humanitarian stockpile” of inoculations for refugees and others who may not be vaccinated by governments have been temporarily shelved.\\nIsrael, Bahrain and the UAE have delivered the most doses per capita, with more than one in four Israelis having received a dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech formulation.

       "  'The US is under increasing pressure to share Covid-19 vaccine doses with less wealthy nations, as advocates call for prevention of an emerging “vaccine apartheid” and point to the strategic and diplomatic importance of sharing essential medicines.\\nCalls to share vaccine doses grew louder this week after the Biden administration announced an additional purchase of 100 million vaccine doses from Johnson & Johnson. The American government has now bought enough doses of vaccines from Moderna, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson to vaccinate 500 million people – nearly the entire eligible population twice over.\\nThe administration also holds the rights to 100 million AstraZeneca vaccine doses. The vaccine has not been authorized in the US, but is authorized for use elsewhere in the world. AstraZeneca asked the US to give “thoughtful consideration” to donating the vaccines elsewhere, a spokesperson for the company said.\\n“I’m doing this because, in this wartime effort, we need maximum flexibility,” Biden said at a White House briefing announcing the purchase this week. “There is always a chance that we’ll encounter unexpected challenges.”\\nOn Friday, Biden and the leaders of Japan, Australia and India – an informal working group known as the Quad announced they would work to increase manufacturing capacity, with the aim of sending 1bn doses of Covid-19 vaccines to Asian and Pacific island countries by 2022.\\nBut Biden administration officials have continued to resist sending stockpiled vaccine doses abroad, saying it is part of a plan to be “over-prepared and over-supplied” in the event emerging Covid-19 variants or waning immunity require booster shots.\\n“We want to be a part of the effort around the world to vaccinate people around the world in a range of countries,” said the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, citing the US’s $2bn commitment to Covax, the global effort to share Covid-19 vaccines.\\nHowever, she said the president’s “first priority and focus is on ensuring that the American people are vaccinated. And once we are at that point, we will have a discussion about what’s next”.\\nThe administration’s strategy is also a hedge against any potential manufacturing disruptions, and could provide a supply of vaccines for children, if and when clinical trials show they are safe for use in children younger than 16.\\nThe Biden administration intends to lift all vaccine eligibility requirements by 1 May, and hopes to vaccinate all eligible 267 million Americans by the Fourth of July holiday. More than 530,000 Americans have died after contracting the virus, a number the the administration often cites when defending its reliance on the vaccine rollout.\\n“As I’ve told you before, I carry a card in my pocket with the number of Americans who have died from Covid to date,” said Biden in a primetime speech on Thursday. “It’s on the back of my schedule. As of now, the total deaths in America: 527,726. That’s more deaths than in world war I, world war II, the Vietnam war and 9/11 combined.”\\nHowever, countries such as China and Russia have agreed to share vaccines to gain a strategic advantage. China’s vaccine manufacturers have pledged half a billion doses to 45 countries, according to an Associated Press tally.\\n“We may be outcompeted by others who are more willing to share, even if they’re doing it for cynical reasons,” said Ivo H Daalder, a former Nato ambassador and the president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, to the New York Times. “I think countries are going to remember who was there for us when we needed them.”\\nA recent analysis by the World Bank found 82% of high-income countries have begun vaccinations, compared to 3% of low-income countries. A January forecast by the Economist Intelligence Unit found middle-income countries will likely mass vaccinate their populations by the end of 2022, but 84 of the world’s poorest nations will not likely complete mass vaccination campaigns until at least 2024, and may never reach herd immunity.\\n“It’s going to define the global economy, the global political landscape, travel, pretty much everything,” said Agathe Demarais, forecasting director for the unit, at the time the report was released.\\nAdvocates have described the gulf in vaccine access between rich and poor countries as a potential “vaccine apartheid”. Many have also said failure to share vaccines threatens to repeat the failures of the HIV/AIDS epidemic.\\n“A me-first approach might serve short-term political interests, but it is self-defeating and will lead to a protracted recovery, with trade and travel continuing to suffer,” wrote Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus in the Guardian.\\n“The threat is clear: as long as the virus is spreading anywhere, it has more opportunities to mutate and potentially undermine the efficacy of vaccines everywhere. We could end up back at square one,” he said.\\nGhebreyesus is among advocates who have called for pharmaceutical companies to waive intellectual property rights granted by the World Trade Organization. The hope is that temporarily waiving patents would allow for broad-based manufacturing of vaccines.\\nThe petition would waive certain rights guaranteed by what is called the TRIPS agreement. The issue is before the WTO, which is expected to debate the petition twice in upcoming meetings in April. The petition is supported largely by lower income countries, and opposed by high-income nations.\\n“We must make sure that in the end we deliver,” said Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the WTO director-general.

Details are expected to be finalized in the coming days.\\nThe news coincided with an announcement that Mexico will close its northern and southern borders to non-essential travel, prompting speculation that the two agreements were related.\\nMexico has not imposed travel restrictions during the pandemic and does not demand Covid tests from travellers. But it has been beefing up enforcement to slow the stream of migrants heading to the US.\\nThe White House spokeswoman, Jen Psaki, said the vaccines deal with Mexico and increased immigration enforcement were “unrelated”.\\nNews of the deal comes as a relief for both Canada and Mexico.\\n“God bless America – they’re coming to our rescue,” said the Ontario premier, Doug Ford, following news of the deal. “That’s what true neighbours do.”\\nPublic health officials in Canada fear that the country – especially its most populous province of Ontario – is headed for a third wave of infections. On Wednesday, the province’s scientific advisory table called for a strict three-week lockdown to combat an explosion of cases linked to coronavirus variants.\\nCanada has secured a series of direct deals with pharmaceutical companies to secure its own supply, but vaccine distribution has also been held up by supply-chain issues.\\nMexico’s government has boasted of having signed agreements with Russia, China and other providers to provide enough doses for its entire population, but the rollout of its vaccination programme has been dogged by delays.\\n“Mexico’s main problem starts with not buying vaccines on time,” said Xavier Tello, a health policy analyst in Mexico City. “Canada has vaccines but not an organized strategy. Mexico has no vaccines and no strategy.”\\nAccording to the World Health Organization, nearly 80% of the vaccines manufactured so far have been administered in only 10 countries.\\nCanada ranks about 22nd in the number of doses administered, with about 8% of the population getting at least one shot. That compares with 21% in the US and 25% in Chile. Mexico, meanwhile, has administered jabs to just 3.8% of its population.\\nMexico has also pursued a quixotic and haphazard strategy, in which inhabitants of rural areas have been prioritized over city-dwellers – and even health workers.\\n“The problem from the beginning was there is no expert or head of the vaccination program in Mexico. Everything is done by different people in the cabinet, people who don’t have knowledge of vaccines,” said Roselyn Lemus-Martin, a Mexican Covid-19 researcher.\\nMexico’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, had been calling on Biden to release the AstraZeneca vaccines. He raised the issue when the two presidents spoke on 2 March.\\n“There’s a diplomatic case of: they’re my neighbours and it’s in the US interest that Mexico and Canada are vaccinated quickly,” Lemus-Martin said.\\n“If Mexico is not vaccinated, people who travel to the US, they’re going to probably bring new variants and there are going to probably be a surge of cases … especially with the new variants because we don’t know what variants are in Mexico,” where there is little testing.\\nThe “releasable” vaccines are ready to be used once they arrive. Under the deal, the United States will share doses with Mexico and Canada now with the understanding that they will pay the United States back with doses in return. The official said that would take place later this year.',\n",

       "  'A vaccine against malaria has been shown to be highly effective in trials in Africa, holding out the real possibility of slashing the death toll of a disease that kills 400,000 mostly small children every year.\\nThe vaccine, developed by scientists at the Jenner Institute of Oxford University, showed up to 77% efficacy in a trial of 450 children in Burkina Faso over 12 months.\\nThe hunt for a malaria vaccine has been going on the best part of a century. One, the Mosquirix vaccine developed by GlaxoSmithKline, has been through lengthy clinical trials but is only partially effective, preventing 39% of malaria cases and 29% of severe malaria cases among small children in Africa over four years. It is being piloted by the World Health Organization in parts of Kenya, Ghana and Malawi.\\nThe Oxford vaccine is the first to meet the WHO goal of 75% efficacy against the mosquito-borne parasite disease. Larger trials are now beginning, involving 4,800 children in four countries.\\nProf Adrian Hill, director of the Jenner Institute, where the Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid vaccine was invented, said he believed the vaccine had the potential to cut the death toll dramatically. “What we’re hoping to do is take that 400,000 down to tens of thousands in the next five years, which would be absolutely fantastic.”\\nOther interventions, such as impregnated bednets and malarial drugs, have reduced the death toll from a million a year, he said, and those must continue. But, if the vaccine could cut deaths to the tens of thousands, they might be able to look towards “a greater goal – eventually eradicating malaria”.\\nHill said the institute might apply for emergency approval for the malaria vaccine just as it did for the Covid jab. “I’m making the argument as forcefully as I can, that because malaria kills a lot more people than Covid in Africa, you should think about emergency-use authorisation for a malaria vaccine for use in Africa. And that’s never been done before.”\\nThe institute would probably ask the regulatory bodies in Europe or the UK for a scientific opinion on the vaccine and then apply to the World Health Organization for approval for use in Africa. “They did Covid in months – why shouldn’t they do malaria in a similar length of time as the health problem is an even greater scale in Africa?” Hill said.\\nScientists sound warning note over malaria drug resistance in Africa\\nRead more\\nThe vaccine will be manufactured at large scale and low-cost, say the researchers, who have arranged a deal with the Serum Institute of India, which is involved in manufacturing the Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine.\\nThe Serum Institute has had to delay supplies of the Covid vaccine to the rest of the world because of the huge rise in cases in India, but has promised to deliver 200m doses a year of the malaria vaccine if it is licensed.\\nHill said the best-case scenario was approval by the end of 2022, by which time the Serum Institute would have plenty of capacity.\\nDr Cyrus Poonawalla and Adar Poonawalla, respectively chair and CEO of the Serum Institute, said in a statement that they were “highly excited to see these results on a safe and highly effective malaria vaccine which will be available to the whole world”. The project was through collaboration with Oxford and also Novavax, which is supplying the adjuvant, a substance that enhances the immune system response.\\n“We are highly confident that we will be able to deliver more than 200m doses annually in line with the strategy, as soon as regulatory approvals are available,” they said.\\nThe children in the trial, which is published on Preprints with the Lancet, were five to 17 months old and lived in Nanoro, an area encompassing 24 villages with an approximate population of 65,000 people. They were split into three groups; two had the vaccine, but with either a low or high dose of adjuvant, while the third group were given a rabies vaccine, so acted as a control.\\nThe children had three doses and have since had a further booster jab. The Mosquirix vaccine is also given as four doses.\\nHill said mothers were keen to bring their children back for further shots because of their experience of malaria. Efficacy was 77% in the high-dose adjuvant group and 74% in the lower dose group.\\nGareth Jenkins, of Malaria No More UK, said: “We can end malaria in our generation but only if governments invest in the research needed to deliver the new medicines and products that can accelerate the end of this terrible disease.\\n“The Jenner Institute’s groundbreaking work on both the new Covid-19 and malaria vaccines is a great example of this and demonstrates just how much humanity’s safety is dependent on new science.\\n“An effective and safe malaria vaccine would be a hugely significant extra weapon in the armoury needed to defeat malaria, which still kills over 270,000 children every year. For decades British scientists have been at the forefront of developing new ways to detect, diagnose, test and treat malaria, and we must continue to back them.\\n“A world without malaria is a world safer both for the children who would otherwise be killed by this disease, and for us here at home. Countries freed from the malaria burden will be much better equipped to fight off new disease threats when they inevitably emerge in the future.”\\nThis article was updated on 27 April 2021 to clarify the publishing details of the trial results.',\n",
       "  'Authorities in Germany and France are under pressure to come up with creative solutions to shift the AstraZeneca vaccine at higher speed in order to avoid a pile-up of unused doses over the coming weeks.\\nOn Monday, France’s medical regulator reversed its advice not to use the AstraZeneca jab on over-65s, and Germany’s vaccination committee is coming under increasing pressure to follow suit or even scrap prioritisation altogether.\\nBoth countries have been slow to administer the Oxford-developed vaccine, subject to an acrimonious tug-of-war over delayed deliveries between its Swedish-British producer and the European commission in January.\\nThe utilisation rate of the AstraZeneca jab in France stands at 24%, an official with the health ministry said on Tuesday, well below a target set at 80-85%. In Germany two-thirds of 1.4m delivered doses remained in storage on Monday.\\nIn search of an explanation, much has been made of anecdotal reports of a reluctant public in both countries holding out for BioNTech’s “Rolls Royce vaccine”, which in early trials had shown a higher efficacy in battling Covid-19 infections.\\nIn the western German city of Duisburg, for example, a spokesperson said 50% to 70% of appointments for an injection with the AstraZeneca jab had either been not taken up or cancelled.\\nBut on closer inspection, AstraZeneca scepticism appears to be a local phenomenon restricted to specific regions, with logistical problems likely to play a much bigger part.\\nIn Germany’s second largest city, Hamburg, authorities said they had experienced barely any reluctance among those who were offered the Oxford jab, but conceded that the decision to clear the vaccine only for those under 65 had created “not inconsiderable logistical problems”.\\n“We’d hoped that the AstraZeneca vaccine would be one of the key drivers of our programme, since its modest storage requirements meant we could have administered it via doctors’ practices before the BioNTech or Moderna vaccines,” said Martin Helfrich, a spokesperson for the northern city state’s health ministry.\\nThe German decision not to clear the vaccine for over-65s meant authorities had to actively seek out younger people in the top priority group. Finding essential workers such as medical staff or firefighters was relatively quickly done through unions and labour associations.\\nBut reaching younger people with pre-existing conditions was a more laborious task, with the state having to invite them by post to book an appointment over the phone, causing considerable delays.\\nGermany set to give AstraZeneca jab to older people\\nRead more\\nSome cities have started trialling creative ways to shift unwanted stock: for every dose currently left over in Duisburg, specially developed software sends out text messages to three people on a list of interested volunteers. The first to respond is given an appointment to get the jab.\\nIn France, reports of AstraZeneca hesitancy have similarly overshadowed flaws in the design of the country’s rollout strategy.\\nWhile a handful of doctors have said publicly they are not recommending the jab, and some healthcare workers have reportedly been reluctant to take it because of the side-effects experienced by some colleagues, there is little evidence that the AstraZeneca vaccine is being actively refused by the general public.\\nAnalysts have said the large number of unused AstraZeneca doses seems to be more a result of the government focusing exclusively – and, critics argue, inflexibly – on vaccinating the oldest and most at-risk groups, such as care home residents, for whom the shot had not been approved, with no back-up plan for using spare doses.\\nLike most EU countries, France has also not followed the UK in extending the gap between the first and second doses of the Covid vaccine beyond the manufacturer’s recommended period, meaning it has to keep more in reserve for early second doses.\\nAs millions of doses by AstraZeneca, BioNTech and Moderna are due to arrive across the EU this month, the problem in France and Germany is shifting from one of under-supply to that of doctors not being able to get the vaccine into people’s arms quickly enough.\\nIf Germany were to continue vaccinating people at its current pace, Die Welt newspaper calculated on Monday, the country would have piled up almost 5m unused doses by the third week of March.\\nFrance’s slow rollout is set to accelerate significantly, with general practitioners authorised to administer shots since last week and pharmacies following suit this week after a ruling by the country’s health regulator on Tuesday.\\nThe French health minister, Olivier Véran, said France should deliver 6m first jabs in March, double the number given during the first two months of the inoculation campaign. The prime minister, Jean Castex, said last week that all over-50s would be offered a jab by mid-May.\\nIn Germany, too, GPs will eventually be drawn into the vaccination rollout, though not until the country receives about 3m doses a week, meaning doctors will not be in a position to choose some of their patients over others.\\nIn Hamburg, the health ministry spokesperson said he expected there to be a “tetchy period” in early April, when the city’s vaccination centres are running at full capacity but there are not yet enough doses to supply to GPs.\\nIn the meantime, there is still room for making the German operation run more efficiently in its current form. Six of the country’s 16 states on Monday were reported to have vaccinated no people on Sunday whatsoever.',\n",
       "  \"As France and Germany join Ireland, Norway, Denmark and the Netherlands in suspending the use of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine – even though the European Medicines Agency and the World Health Organization are advising people to continue taking it – the common refrain in European governments is that they are acting out of “an abundance of caution”.\\nThere have been a handful of reports of blood clots in people recently vaccinated and also a rarer condition called thrombocytopenia, in which people do not make enough platelets. That can result in excessive bleeding. Deaths have been reported in Austria and Italy, which stopped the use of one batch of vaccine for fear it was contaminated. Meanwhile a further death from thrombocytopenia has been reported in Norway, as well as three hospitalisations.\\n01:33\\nBenefits of Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine 'firmly outweigh any risk', says EU drugs regulator – video\\nWhile governments are pulling the plug, most scientists are rolling their eyes. The EMA and WHO are investigating the incidents, but so far there is no evidence that any were caused by the vaccine.\\nExperts say that the numbers of blood clots and thrombocytopenia cases in people who have been vaccinated is no higher than in the population that has not received the jab. The International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis, representing medical experts around the world, said on Friday that “the small number of reported thrombotic events relative to the millions of administered Covid-19 vaccinations does not suggest a direct link”.\\nBlood clots are common, they said, but not more common in people who have had a Covid jab, from evidence so far. They recommended that even people with a history of blood clots or taking blood-thinning drugs should go and get their vaccination.\\nIn the UK, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority and the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), which advises the government, have both been robust. “The UK has administered 11m doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine and there has been no demonstrable difference in the number of blood clots since the vaccine was introduced,” said Prof Anthony Harden, the JCVI deputy chair. The MHRA said it was working closely with its international counterparts and reviewing the cases, but “the evidence available does not suggest the vaccine is the cause”.\\nAstraZeneca itself says there have been 15 deep vein thrombosis (DVT) events and 22 pulmonary embolisms (blood clots in the lungs) across the whole of the EU and UK up to 8 March. “This is much lower than would be expected to occur naturally in a general population of this size and is similar across other licensed Covid-19 vaccines,” it said in a statement.\\nBut these protestations appear not to be cutting much ice with European governments. There are a number of other factors that may be in play.\\nOne is that nobody can rule out very rare side-effects on the basis of trials involving tens of thousands of people. There was such an issue during the swine flu pandemic of 2009. A study later found that one in 55,000 jabs with a vaccine called Pandemrix caused the sleeping disorder narcolepsy in children.\\nFor that reason there will be particularly careful scrutiny of any cases that do not look like ordinary blood clots. In Denmark, a 60-year-old who died was said to have had “highly unusual” symptoms. Norway also said the three people being treated in hospital had “unusual symptoms”.\\n04:44\\nWhat's in a vaccine and what does it do to your body?\\nAnd governments, unlike scientific bodies, have to weigh up other things besides evidence. They will worry about public confidence – in the vaccine and also in ministers’ handling of any concerns. France for instance has struggled over vaccination. There is a long history of public suspicion of drug companies, which contributed to a debacle over the swine flu vaccine. France bought millions of doses, which people turned down. The country had historically low vaccination rates for measles, mumps and rubella in children too, until jabs were made compulsory in schools in 2018.\\nGermany, meanwhile, was the first country to refuse to allow people over the age of 65 to have the AstraZeneca vaccine because of the absence of evidence of how well it worked in older people, indicating a more cautious approach than most.\\nBut the other factor in deciding on suspension could even be supply. In the UK, there are plentiful stocks. In Europe, there are not. AstraZeneca has just cut its proposed deliveries again, down to 30m doses in the first quarter, which is about a third of what was originally promised. Suspending the vaccine is easier in Europe if it is not available in great quantities anyway.\\nThis article was amended on 16 and 17 March 2021. An earlier version contained some incorrect information about narcolepsy, which has been removed. Also, it said that France “has low vaccination rates for measles, mumps and rubella”; this was until jabs were made compulsory in schools in 2018, and the text has been updated to reflect this.\",\n",
       "  'Experts warned of damage to confidence in the UK’s vaccine programme after 10 million adults under 30 were told they will be offered an alternative to the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab following concerns over rare blood clots.\\nHealthy 18- to 29-year-olds who are not at high risk of Covid should have the option of a different jab if one is available in their area, the government’s joint committee on vaccines and immunisation (JCVI) said, weeks after some European countries suspended the use of Oxford/AstraZeneca jabs in younger people.\\nFor older people, the benefits of the vaccine – the most widely used in the UK – far outweigh the risks, the JCVI added. The UK has recorded 79 rare blood clots cases, 19 of whom died, out of 20m AstraZeneca jabs administered.\\nEngland’s deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, called the move “a course correction” and said there should be little or no impact on the vaccine rollout timeline, though he warned that under-30s could face short delays in getting inoculated.\\nBoris Johnson tweeted: “We will follow today’s updated advice, which should allow people of all ages to continue to have full confidence in vaccines, helping us save lives and cautiously return towards normality.”\\nThe recommendation came as it was confirmed that the European regulator is examining whether other vaccines using similar technology to the AstraZeneca jab pose any risk.\\nThere had been three cases of venous thromboembolism blood clots with low platelets involving the Johnson & Johnson jab, a European Medicines Agency (EMA) official said.\\nSymptoms of the rare brain blood clots include severe headaches and blurred vision, and most cases occur within two weeks of a jab – but such events are treatable if medical help is sought, experts said.\\n02:13\\nPossible link between AstraZeneca vaccine and blood clots, says EU regulator - video\\nIn the UK up to 31 March, there were 79 reports of these rare blood clots with low platelets – some but not all of them in the brain, it was revealed on Wednesday. Of those affected, 19 people died, although it is not known if the blood clots were the cause in every case.\\nMore were women – 51 – and they were all aged 18-79. Three were under 30. But the recommendation of an alternative vaccine for that age group is because their risk from Covid itself is very low.\\nIn older age groups, the experts believe, the benefits of vaccination significantly outweigh the rare side-effect risk, but in younger people “it is more finely balanced”.\\nDr June Raine, CEO of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority (MHRA), said the risk was “extremely small” and the authority had not yet concluded that the vaccine was responsible.\\n“The evidence is firming up. While it is a strong possibility, more work is needed to establish beyond all doubt that the vaccine has caused this side-effect,” she said.\\nThere are concerns, however, that confidence in the AstraZeneca jab has been hit.\\n“Today’s decision is a severe blow to the public’s vaccine confidence, which is already fragile,” said Dr Chris Papadopoulos, principal lecturer in public health at the University of Bedfordshire. It might be the right decision, but needed to be coupled to efforts to counter vaccine hesitancy, he added.\\nProf Martin Hibberd, of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said it was a sensible decision. “However, I would like to see the evidence that the other vaccines are safer.”\\nThe Royal College of Midwives (RCM) said young people and pregnant women would be concerned.\\nWhile “blood clots are incredibly rare”, the college said, the JCVI had “taken the right decision in exercising caution”. Women who are pregnent should raise any questions with their midwife or obstetrician. The RCM added: “Pregnant women should not be excluded from the vaccination programme and we urge the MHRA and JCVI to redouble their efforts to support this group.”\\nThe new JCVI advice came as the European Medicines Agency said the rare blood clots would be listed formally as a side-effect of the AstraZeneca vaccine, though it did not announce any restrictions on use. Several EU countries, including France and Germany, have already limited use to citizens aged over 55 or 60, or suspended its use entirely.\\nEmer Cooke, executive director of the EMA, said: “In the UK, I cannot comment on the decision-making to restrict to a certain age but what I can tell you is there is a lot more use in the younger age groups in the UK than in the EU at the moment and we will certainly take this into account in our further evaluations.”\\nAsked why European countries have different stances from the UK, Adam Finn from the JCVI said Britain had “extremely detailed data” based on a high number of administered AstraZeneca jabs.\\n“I think other countries in Europe that have seen clusters of cases … they are not in such a good evidence-driven position to make their judgments,” he said, adding that “the risk-benefit [equation] does vary … from one country to another”.\\nThe EMA said it could not identify the cause of the blood-clotting event, which was mostly, but not entirely, in women under 60.\\nIt is advising that healthcare professionals and people getting the vaccine should be made aware of the issue and the symptoms of the clots, which range from shortness of breath and chest pain to persistent headaches and blurred vision.\\n“It is of great importance that healthcare professionals and people coming for vaccination are aware of these risks and look out for signs or symptoms,” said Cooke.\\nLike the EMA, the MHRA is a regulator and an adviser on safety and efficacy to governments.\\nThe UK recommendation that under-30s should be offered an alternative vaccine comes from the JCVI. Its head, Prof Wei Shen Lim, said it had only made the recommendation to government “out of the utmost caution rather than because we have any serious safety concerns”.\\nDr Peter Arlett, the head of the EMA data analytics and methods taskforce, said the agency was examining whether other vaccines posed any risk, citing cases of rare blood clots involving the Johnson & Johnson jab.\\n“There have been three cases with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine of blood clots associated with low platelets which have some similarities to these cases that we’ve been describing today,” he said.\\n“However, the numbers are extremely small compared with the 5 million patients that have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine worldwide. This is, however, under close scrutiny, the [committee] is looking at it carefully, and I think it would be fair to say there’s intensive monitoring of this issue across the vaccines.”\\nA UK government spokesperson said: “The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is safe, effective and has already saved thousands of lives.\\n“Everybody who has already had a first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine should receive a second dose of the same brand, irrespective of age, except for the very small number of people who experienced blood clots with low platelet counts from their first vaccination.”\\nThis article was amended on 8 April 2021 to update a comment from the Royal College of Midwives.',\n",
       "  'T\\nhe day India started coronavirus vaccinations, Amit Mehra’s name was on the priority list. But he never made an appointment. “I’m not inclined to get vaccinated just because it’s available,” says the 47-year-old Delhi hospital worker.\\nTwo and a half thousand miles away, strolling past a popup inoculation centre near Red Square in Moscow, Magomed Zurabov is similarly reluctant. Suspicious that the pandemic was deliberately engineered, he has no intention of being vaccinated, he says. Instead, he is “taking the necessary precautions”: wearing a mask and using disinfectant.\\nAs vaccinations rates soar in Israel, the UK, the United Arab Emirates and other countries that have monopolised supply, and poorer nations make do with a trickle of doses, a third category are beginning long climbs. Supply is less of an issue in Russia, China or India, all of which produce their own vaccines. But their respective government programmes have had slow starts, and there has been little public clamour to speed things up.\\n“People have not shown that eagerness and urgency to be vaccinated,” says Ajeet Jain, a doctor at the Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality hospital in Delhi. “India is going through that phase where the disease is no longer prevalent except in a few states. People are relaxed that the disease is over from their point of view.”\\nA woman receives a dose of a Covid-19 jab at Dasappa hospital in Bangalore, India, this week. Photograph: Jagadeesh Nv/EPA\\nThe experience of India, Russia and China may prove, in time, to be typical. Even once vaccine shortages are alleviated, much of the world could still take years to achieve widespread Covid-19 vaccination, encumbered by the challenges of reaching vast and far-flung populations, lack of interest from the public and other, more pressing health priorities.\\nSome countries may shake off growing pains: India’s rollout has accelerated in the past fortnight, with private clinics enlisted to help administer shots and new groups, including anyone over 60, invited to make appointments. The programme hit 3m doses a day this week which, if maintained, would put it within reach of its target of vaccinating 20% of the population by August.\\nUptake was slower than expected among the 30 million healthcare and frontline workers who were prioritised for the first round of doses, with some hesitant about receiving Covaxin, a locally developed vaccine that was pressed into use before the release of phase 3 trial results. (Interim data has since shown that it is 81% effective.)\\n“That caused quite a bit of confusion, as a result of which healthcare workers who were supposed to be vaccinated in the first round, and who understood this process a little better than other people, didn’t come forward as much as they should have,” says Dr Shahid Jameel, a virologist and director of the Trivedi school of biosciences at Ashoka University.\\nIndia has also held off from deploying its entire workforce of vaccine deliverers to fight Covid-19, keeping about half at work administering jabs for other deadly diseases, Jameel says. “There is a childhood immunisation programme, there is one for pregnant mothers, and they have to go on unhindered despite Covid.”\\nThe most significant impediment may be that, since September, virus rates in India have dropped steeply. And in a country with a median age of about 28, Covid-19 has not proved especially deadly, implicated in about 160,000 recorded deaths, a third of the number of Indians who die from tuberculosis each year. Signs of a second wave taking off in the past week may change the calculation for some.\\n“Look at death rates in South Asia and you’ll know why people are not dying to get vaccinated,” says Oommen C Kurian, a senior fellow at Delhi’s Observer Research Foundation thinktank. “Their sense of risk is considerably lower than, say, a Londoner.”\\nThe same is true for the average resident of Beijing, though not for demographic reasons. China has employed blunt but effective quarantine measures to contain Sars-CoV-2 successfully, and life in the country has largely returned to normal. Though it authorised its first vaccines for emergency use in July, just 4% of the country has been vaccinated so far.\\n“One of the most important contributors is this perception that China has a low risk of infection,” said Yanzhong Huang, director of the Center for Global Health Studies at Seton Hall University in New Jersey. “So people think, why bother to get vaccinated? We’re already safe.”\\nThe country aims to inoculate 40% of its population by July, a target that will require administering about 4m shots a day, up from about 640,000 a day on the latest public figures.\\nBut Beijing must also balance commitments to supply at least 463m doses to countries overseas, many of them donations to strategic partners. So far, it is under little pressure to hoard those vaccines for use at home. “People view this as an example of China being a global leader, something that showcases China being a responsible and reliable great power,” Huang says.\\nRussia has been hit harder by the virus, losing 90,000 lives on official figures thought to be a significant underestimate. But there, too, uptake of the vaccine is tracking well short of government targets of inoculating 60% of the population by mid-year.\\nA poll of Russians this month found that two-thirds were unwilling to receive the locally developed Sputnik-V shot, in spite of peer-reviewed research suggesting that it is safe and effective. Their scepticism extended to the origins of the coronavirus, with 64% believing that it was a biological weapon, the independent poll said. (Most virologists disagree and say there is no evidence that the virus was engineered.)\\nLack of trust in the Russian government is a key hurdle, says Sergei Rybakov, a representative of the Doctors’ alliance, an opposition-linked medical union that has criticised the official response to the pandemic. Though the state has marketed Sputnik-V overseas, including with its own Twitter account, it has done less to promote the vaccine among Russians, he says.\\n“The task of the state is to show that the vaccine is necessary, the vaccine is safe. In Russia this hasn’t been done to the extent it needs to be,” Rybakov said. “You need to show people that not getting the vaccine is more dangerous than getting it.”\\nSimilar hurdles are likely to slow rollouts elsewhere, too, as countries assemble one of the largest logistical operations most have ever undertaken. Even once supplies are secured, some may struggle for years to reach the 70% of the population thought to be required for herd immunity, says Babak Javid, an infectious diseases scientist at the University of California, San Francisco.\\nThey might focus their efforts instead on reaching healthcare workers and the most vulnerable, he says. “You’re not going to eliminate Covid deaths, but you’ll eliminate the likelihood of healthcare infrastructure being overwhelmed.”',\n",
       "  'Europe’s vaccination campaign is “unacceptably slow” and rising infection rates in most countries across the continent mean its coronavirus situation is “more worrying than we have seen in several months”, the World Health Organization has said.\\nAfter France announced tougher restrictions nationwide and Italy extended its curbs until the end of the month, the WHO regional director, Hans Kluge, said on Thursday that new cases in Europe had surged from fewer than 1m a week to about 1.6m a week.\\n“Vaccines present our best way out of this pandemic,” Kluge said. “Not only do they work, they are highly effective in preventing infection.” However, he said, the slow pace of their rollout on the continent was “prolonging the pandemic”.\\nKluge said falling infections among the over-80s in Europe showed the impact of vaccination on the spread of the virus, while data from the UK’s campaign suggested vaccines had so far “saved, at the very least, over 6,000 lives among people over 70”.\\nBut he said that across the WHO’s Europe region, made up of 53 countries including Russia and several central Asian nations, only 10% of people had received one dose and 4% were fully vaccinated, while barely 60% of lower- and lower-middle-income countries in the region had started inoculating.\\n“Let me be clear: we must speed up the process by ramping up manufacturing, reducing barriers to administering vaccines, and using every single vial we have in stock, now,” Kluge said, urging all governments to share excess shots.\\nThe WHO said 27 European countries were in partial or full nationwide lockdown, and 21 had night-time curfews. “As long as vaccine coverage remains low, we need to apply the same public health and social measures as we have in the past,” Kluge said. “Now is not the time to relax.”\\nUnderlining the apparent lack of vaccine urgency in some countries, Spain’s Madrid region stopped administering shots at health centres for four days so medical staff could rest over Easter, despite pleas from the national government to continue.\\nThe health minister, Carolina Darias, said last week it was “very important” to keep vaccinating over the break to make up for earlier delays due to supply shortages, but Madrid authorities said more shots had been given earlier in the week to compensate. Spain’s 16 other regions were reported to be administering vaccines as normal.\\nIn Germany, President Frank-Walter Steinmeier became the first high-profile German official to receive a dose of the AstraZeneca jab as politicians joined an effort to shore up confidence in the troubled Anglo-Swedish vaccine.\\nSteinmeier, 65, received his shot at Berlin’s military hospital under new guidelines restricting the vaccine’s use for the under-60s. “I trust the vaccines authorised in Germany,” he said. “Vaccinating is the decisive step out of the pandemic.”\\nChancellor Angela Merkel announced the guidelines on Tuesday after Germany’s vaccine regulator reported 31 cases of AstraZeneca recipients developing cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, a rare blood-clotting disorder.\\nThe health minister Jens Spahn, 40, had appealed to politicians over 60 to show their faith in the shot. People under the age of 60 can still take it in consultation with their doctor and providing they have been made fully aware of the potential risks.\\nSeveral other countries including France, Spain and Canada have also imposed age restrictions on the vaccine. The European Medicines Agency has said experts reviewing links with the rare reports of clotting have found no specific risk factors, but are continuing their investigation.\\nFrance to close schools and stop domestic travel after Covid surge\\nRead more\\nThe French president, Emmanuel Macron, announced an acceleration of France’s vaccination programme to make shots available to all over-50s by mid-May as he unveiled new Covid restrictions on Wednesday, stopping short of a strict lockdown.\\nSchools will close for three weeks, non-essential shops will shut and people are restricted to travelling within 10km of their homes, with travel over the Easter weekend tolerated for those seeking to escape to second homes or rental properties but family gatherings discouraged.\\nThe prime minister, Jean Castex, on Thursday defended the measures, aimed at slowing the spread of the virus without shutting the country down entirely, as “consistent and pragmatic” after the opposition Les Républicains party described the country’s health situation as a “catastrophic stalemate”.\\nCastex also said alcoholic drinks would be banned in parks and other outdoor public spaces, and police would be quick to disperse groups of more than six people, after French media broadcast images of carousing crowds on riverbanks and squares in cities including Paris and Lyon.\\nItaly extended restrictions closing restaurants, shops and museums over Easter until the end of April, but added that “an easing of measures” could be announced if the trend of the pandemic and the country’s vaccination rollout warranted it.\\nThe decree, approved late on Wednesday by the prime minister Mario Draghi’s government, made vaccines compulsory for healthcare workers, with those refusing to be vaccinated liable to be reassigned away from the public or have pay suspended.',\n",
       "  'P\\nublic health authorities want people to keep wearing masks and social distancing, even after they receive a vaccine. This might seem counterintuitive – after all, if someone gets a vaccine, aren’t they protected from the coronavirus?\\nThe answer is complicated: the vast majority of people who are vaccinated will be protected from Covid-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, vaccinated people may still be able to transmit the virus, even though they do not display any symptoms.\\n“We know now the vaccines can protect, but what we haven’t had enough time to really understand is – does it protect from spreading?” said Avery August, professor of immunology at Cornell University.\\nThat is because the the SARS-CoV-2 virus may still colonize the respiratory tract, even as systemic immune cells protect the overall body from the disease it causes – Covid-19.\\nHere is how this works:\\nThe coronavirus vaccine is injected deep into the tissue.\\nIt prompts our bodies to form antibodies to fight the virus systemically.\\nSome of those systemic antibodies circulate to other parts of the body, and protect us against severe disease.\\nCoronavirus typically enters the body through our nasal cavities.\\nScientists are still studying whether the body produces enough antibodies in the nose to prevent the virus from proliferating there.\\nMeanwhile the virus will also try to proliferate in other parts of the body, like our respiratory system.\\nSystemic antibodies will likely kill them off. That means a vaccinated person probably won’t develop symptoms, even if the virus multiplies in the nose.\\nBut vaccinated people may still carry enough virus in the nose to infect others.\\nSo if a vaccinated person breathes or sneezes they could still infect someone else, even if they feel fine.\\nThis means vaccinated people still have to wear masks and socially distance, even if their individual risk is much lower.\\nWhen can I stop wearing a mask?\\nHold on to your mask(s) for the foreseeable future. Right now, there are several unknowns, which make mask-wearing and social distancing important to protect the wider community.\\nFirst, scientists do not know how Covid-19 vaccines may protect against asymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (as explained above). There are promising signs – but research remains incomplete. Researchers also do not know how long Covid-19 vaccines may protect people from the virus.\\nScientists will also be closely watching how evolutionary changes in the virus, or variants, impact the effectiveness of vaccines. Researchers have already found efficacy of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine was reduced in South Africa, where the B1351 variant is present.\\nHowever, the most important factor may be the extent to which eligible adults accept the vaccine. Children are able to spread the disease, but not eligible for the vaccine; some people may be too immune-compromised to take it; and others may face bureaucratic barriers to vaccination.\\nWhat’s the point of getting the vaccine if I still have to wear a mask?\\nThink of mask-wearing and social distancing as a continuum of risk-mitigation strategies, which are in place while scientists conduct research, more and more people get vaccinated, and the prevalence of Covid-19 goes down.\\nFor example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said people can gather indoors, without masks, with other fully vaccinated people. People are considered “fully vaccinated” two weeks after they receive their last vaccine. Those same people then need to be conscientious about social distancing and mask-wearing in public, as they could potentially transmit the disease in the wider community.\\nThe hope is that as more and more of the public is vaccinated, fewer people will have severe cases of Covid-19, and the pressure on the health system will decline with the prevalence of the disease.\\n“Hopefully we can get a majority of the population vaccinated,” said Dr Bruce Y Lee, a professor of health policy at the City University of New York’s School of Public Health. “That’s when we can start talking about moving toward normal.”\\nWhen will we have these answers?\\nStudies on the extent to which vaccines protect against transmission are continuing, and promising, but incomplete. It is unlikely the vaccines will provide complete, or “sterilizing”, protection. Only a handful of vaccines are able to make that claim, including for example the smallpox vaccine. However, if a vaccine significantly reduced transmission, it would be very good news for the world’s ability to contain the virus.\\nUnder normal circumstances, these kinds of questions might have been answered in years-long vaccine clinical trials. In this emergency situation, stopping the disease was a more important goal, and available vaccines do that very effectively.\\n“We would probably know as more and more people get vaccinated, somewhere near the middle of September,” said August.\\nImportantly though, vaccines do not necessarily need to provide complete protection to help fight the pandemic. “If everyone is vaccinated then there is less virus around,” said August.',\n",
       "  \"The UK’s chief medical officers have defended plans to delay giving the second dose of a Covid vaccine to more than 500,000 people who have received the first jab, saying they believed the public would “understand and thank us for this decisive action” despite an outcry among doctors.\\nRecipients of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine had previously been told there would be a three-week gap between doses, with many already booked in for their second jab.\\nBut the government announced a change to its Covid vaccination strategy on Wednesday, saying second doses of the newly approved Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine and the previously approved Pfizer/BioNTech jab would now be given up to 12 weeks after the first dose.\\nThe move applies to people scheduled to have their second dose of the Pfizer jab after 4 January, as well as those yet to receive either jab. The government said it hoped the approach would free up more doses and mean as many people as possible would soon get their first jab and have some protection against the disease.\\nThe new regime was backed by the chief medical officers of the four UK nations, with instructions given to health service leaders in England by NHS bosses on Wednesday to postpone many of the scheduled second Pfizer/BioNTech jabs.\\nThe announcement caused controversy, however. Pfizer and BioNTech warned that two doses of their vaccine were required for maximum protection against Covid and that they did not have evidence that the first dose alone offered protection after three weeks.\\nAzeem Majeed, a professor of primary care and public health at Imperial College London and a practising GP, said he was shocked by the change of plan.\\n“We’ve got thousands or perhaps tens of thousands of people who have already booked their second jabs, and these are people who are all elderly, so they often have to make special arrangements for their care or have someone to bring them down. Someone is going to have to ring all these patients to cancel their appointments and rebook them, so it is going to create a lot of work for people as well,” he said.\\n“Clearly the people making these rules are not the ones having to enforce them. I understand the rationale that the government wants to increase the vaccine supply to make sure more people are immunised, but I think that could have been done for people starting from now, rather than cancelling the ones who have already been booked in, which is very disruptive.”\\nIn a joint statement on Thursday night, Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer of England, and his counterparts in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland stood by their decision, although they acknowledged that it would “distress patients who were looking forward to being fully immunised”. They added: “However, we are all conscious that for every 1,000 people boosted with a second dose of Covid-19 vaccine in January (who will as a result gain marginally on protection from severe disease), 1,000 new people can’t have substantial initial protection which is in most cases likely to raise them from 0% protected to at least 70% protected.”\\nThey added: “We have to follow public health principles and act at speed if we are to beat this pandemic which is running rampant in our communities, and we believe the public will understand and thank us for this decisive action.”\\nEarlier, one doctor who spoke to the Guardian on condition on anonymity said they hoped to continue with the original schedule for the second dose rather than cancelling appointments, saying that to do otherwise would put their most vulnerable patients at risk and break promises to patients.\\nAlison Bolam, a GP at Horfield health centre in Bristol, said her practice would take a similar approach. “If we try to ring and cancel 1,000 80-year-olds, and then ring 1,000 75-year-olds and ask them to come in instead, we risk wasting vaccine because we don’t have the staff capacity to do that with the bank holiday in the way,” she said. “If anyone gets the first vaccine now, the second one will be 10 to 12 weeks later, but for anybody who has already had it, they will get their second vaccine as originally scheduled.”\\nThe British Medical Association said it was unreasonable and unfair to expect practices to cancel and rebook appointments for patients to have their second dose.\\nThe chair of the BMA’s GP committee, Dr Richard Vautrey, said: “Local leaders are telling us that is unprofessional and impractical to amend the appointments for thousands of frail, elderly patients, particularly those booked and who have already made arrangements to have their second vaccination in the next two weeks.”\\nVautrey called on the government to publish a scientifically validated justification for the new approach, adding that rebooking appointments would cause huge logistical problems.\\nThe Guardian understands a number of NHS clinical commissioning groups were holding meetings on Thursday on the issue, to decide how to proceed.\\nDr Helen Salisbury, a GP and medical adviser to the health experience research group at the University of Oxford, tweeted that the health secretary Matt Hancock, should help to phone her elderly patients and explain why their second jab had been delayed. She said her primary care network needed to cancel and rebook 1,160 appointments.\\n“At 5 mins per phone call, that’s 193 hours’ work. Not to mention the grief & anger,” she tweeted.\\nHer comments unleashed a flurry of responses from other GPs, with some questioning whether it was ethical to delay a second dose when patients had given consent for the first dose on the premise that they would receive the second three weeks later.\\nThe Doctors’ Association UK said it had sent a letter to Hancock and others involved in the change of strategy regarding the Pfizer vaccine. “A patient can’t consent for a treatment then have the treatment changed without their permission, especially when the evidence for change is lacking,” it said. Dr Vinesh Patel, a GP partner and spokesman for the DAUK’s GP committee, said using the Pfizer jab outside the trialled vaccination regime was a huge gamble.\\nOthers, however, welcomed the change in approach. Dr Ed Turnham, a GP in Norwich, said the MHRA should be congratulated for its “brave, pragmatic decision”.\\n“I think most of our elderly patients will be happy that this will reduce the delay in protecting their friends and relatives, and reduce the risk of hospitals being overwhelmed,” he tweeted.\\nShare your story\\nShare your stories\\nIf you have been affected or have any information, we'd like to hear from you.

The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation had “put forward a compelling case that this is the best way to protect as many people as possible from the virus, and this is the decision that has been made,” he said.\\nBut he added: “NHS England’s guidance does allow for some clinical discretion for practices to go ahead with second vaccinations where necessary, and if a practice uses this it is important it is respected.”\",\n",
       "  'I\\nt is the question being asked with increasing urgency around the world, at least in countries where the vaccine is already available: how much freedom to live life as it was before the pandemic should be granted to those who have been vaccinated against Covid-19?\\nIts impacts range from the speed at which economies can open, to when grandparents and grandchildren can hug again, but it is causing growing unease among decision-makers who warn there is a danger of dividing societies already under huge strain due to pandemic restraints.\\nGermany’s ethics council, an independent body that advises the government, has recommended that no special conditions be granted to the inoculated. It declared it was “currently unacceptable to lift state restrictions on civil liberties”, arguing not only was there a lack of evidence over whether vaccinated people could still spread the virus, but that introducing special privileges for them might encourage an “elbow mentality” which could lead to unrest. If there was to be a priority, it should go to the vaccinated residents of care homes in recognition of the extraordinary burdens they face.\\nBut private enterprises including restaurants and cinemas could not be prevented from applying their own rules, the council conceded, and last week the German ticket company Eventim said it had already revamped its online booking service to allow for customers to upload proof that they had been vaccinated in anticipation that organisers of events from concerts to sports tournaments will in future require it as a condition of entry.\\nIsrael opens coronavirus vaccines to all over-16s\\nRead more\\nState-backed schemes are moving ahead more quickly in Scandinavia, where Denmark has announced plans to introduce a digital vaccine passport and Sweden said it would have a digital vaccine passport by summer if international standards were in place. Sweden’s digitalisation minister, Anders Ygeman, said such documentation would have to become the norm if the world was going to get going again.\\n“When Sweden and countries around us start to open up our societies again, vaccination certificates are likely to be required for travel and possibly for taking part in other activities,” he said.\\nThe UK vaccine minister, Nadhim Zahawi, has said the government does not plan to introduce vaccine passports to enable people to travel abroad, but those who needed proof could get it from their GP.\\nIsraeli officials have hinted at the prospect of a “green passport” to allow vaccinated people to eat in restaurants, go to the theatre and cinema, travel freely and be exempted from quarantine when travelling internationally.\\nThe passport, which would be given to those with two Pfizer shots, has been sold as a way to encourage people to be immunised, but is also viewed as an effort to jump-start the economy. However, as there is uncertainty around whether vaccines reduce transmission, the idea has been met with scepticism.\\nFear over the more transmissible virus variants has delayed a decision and legal issues are causing authorities a headache. A proposal to only allow vaccinated teachers to restart work has face pushback from those who argue it is an illegally coercive measure.\\nIn the US, President Joe Biden asked government agencies to investigate the feasibility of producing digital versions of vaccine certificates in one of his first executive orders. Greece’s prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, has proposed the EU push ahead with a common vaccination certificate that could help create a “fast travel lane”.\\nA universal document, probably digital, providing official proof that someone has been vaccinated against, or tested for, coronavirus may become a reality within months – as much a part of life as going out of the house with a face mask.\\nJapan faces Olympian task with slow start to Covid vaccinations\\nRead more\\nMajor sporting events this year, such as Euro 2021, - to be hosted by 12 cities across Europe, including Rome, London and Glasgow - and the Olympics in Japan, are under pressure over the issue, not least because of the European Union’s problem with vaccine supply. Events may be in jeopardy if organisers insist only the inoculated can attend, but that could be the future for sport.\\nThe president of the Italian football federation, Gabriele Gravina, has met scientific officials to discuss the partial reopening of stadiums to supporters who have received the full two rounds of vaccination. The strategy, according to the leading Italian sports daily La Gazzetta dello Sport, is to pave the way for the opening of Stadio Olimpico in Rome for major matches.\\nGermany’s ethics council has meanwhile ruled out allowing top sportsmen and women to jump the vaccination queue before the Olympics.\\nIn China, where an ambitious vaccination programme aims to immunise 50 million people by the middle of February, authorities have reportedly been working on a plan to integrate vaccine records with the country’s ubiquitous health apps, which might allow travellers to bypass quarantine when journeying between cities and regions. High levels of fear over the virus’s resurgence have reportedly caused the plans to be put on hold.\\nTaiwan feels similarly cautious about vaccines replacing quarantine, which has allowed it to limit its cases to 924 with nine deaths. The mainland affairs council said in December anyone returning to Taiwan would still be required to go into 14 days’ quarantine whether they had been vaccinated or not.\\nThe prospect of vaccine passports as well as cash payments have been raised in Hong Kong, in an attempt to encourage as many people to get immunised as possible when its vaccine programme begins in March. Just 46% of people surveyed by Hong Kong University last month said they would be willing to be vaccinated, due both to distrust of the government and fear of side-effects.\\nIn Brazil, 10 of 11 supreme court judges ruled in December that vaccination could be made indirectly obligatory by allowing schools, public transport, shopping centres and restaurants to demand proof of inoculation. The far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, had said he would refuse a vaccine and defended the rights of others to do the same. “We’re fighting a pandemic – a pandemic that kills people,” Alexandre de Moraes, one of the judges, declared.\\nIn France, which has high levels of vaccine hesitancy, several critics have said vaccination passports could be viewed as a backdoor way to making inoculation mandatory and the prime minister, Jean Castex, has since said legal challenges could consequently arise. “It would be surprising to make a vaccination certificate compulsory,” he said.\\nFrance’s European affairs minister, Clément Beaune, has objected to the idea on grounds of equality, since vaccines have not yet been offered to all. “We are very reluctant,” he said. “It would be shocking, while the campaign is still just starting across Europe, for there to be more important rights for some than for others.”\\nReporting team: Lorenzo Tondo in Palermo, Helen Davidson in Taipei, Tom Phillips in Rio de Janeiro, Jon Henley in Paris and Helena Smith in Athens',\n",
       "  \"W\\nith more than 50 unique vaccination plans across the United States, one’s access to the Covid-19 vaccine depends in large part on where one lives. In Wisconsin, mink farmers are being considered for the next phase of vaccine prioritization. In New Jersey, smokers can get priority access to the vaccine. In Colorado, journalists fall under the category of frontline workers.\\nThis complex system has given rise to a new type of pandemic travel – dubbed “vaccine tourism” – in which people cross state or even country lines to get earlier access. Without standardized protocol, and because of the fractured American health system, tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of people have gotten vaccines outside their home states.\\n“They are coming from Canada, Brazil, New York, Georgia, folks from Minneapolis have come here. Some friends of mine in St Petersburg [Florida] told me that they were in a vaccination line with people from Venezuela,” said Dr Jay Wolfson, a professor of public health at the University of South Florida.\\nHe credits advertisements from international travel agencies with at least part of the vaccine tourist influx. “I get calls all the time from people saying, ‘Jay, can you get me in someplace?’ – and I can’t. And I won’t.”\\nFlorida has been one of the most popular vaccine tourism destinations for domestic and international travelers alike, due to the state’s initial policy of vaccinating anyone over the age of 65 years old. The state recently implemented new ID rules in an attempt to direct more vaccines to Florida residents, but not before about 50,000 out-of-state recipients got a dose. Though some of these vaccine recipients are seasonal state residents, or snowbirds, whose decision to spend the winter in Florida was unrelated to their vaccination prospects, many thousands have come to the state just for a shot.\\nThe 50,000 doses represent only about 3.4% of the total vaccinations administered in Florida, but even a small percentage going to out-of-state recipients in any state can affect the entire country’s vaccination infrastructure.\\n“Administering a vaccine dose involves appointments, involves needles, involves human resources. And all of those resources that are vehicles for delivering doses of the vaccine are tied to a local community, state, or city in terms of allocation,” said Dr Kyle Ferguson, a postdoctoral fellow in the division of medical ethics at the New York University Grossman School of Medicine.\\nCities and states generally receive batches of the vaccine from the federal government based on the adult population in the area and plan their distribution strategy accordingly. When someone crosses city, state, or national lines to get a vaccine, it disrupts the success of both jurisdictions’ vaccine rollout.\\nBiden says Congress needs to 'act now' on $1.9tn Covid relief proposal\\nRead more\\n“Vaccine tourists are using their power to create an unfair opportunity for themselves. There are design flaws that people are exploiting, taking advantage of some soft spots in those systems,” said Ferguson. “None of this should be about worthiness or deservingness, but when someone travels for the vaccine, they’re using resources, both doses and all the delivery mechanisms, that have been allocated to a different community.”\\nVaccine tourism can also be risky for patients and healthcare providers. “If you give a dose of the vaccine to somebody who may not be able to return and get their second dose or if there’s an adverse event, who is responsible?” Wolfson asks. “Travelling long distances for a shot, there’s a risk to the patient of not fulfilling the dosage and of not being able to follow up with healthcare providers to have, what we call it in healthcare, continuity of care.”\\nNevertheless, many are willing to take the risk, especially if they are particularly susceptible to health complications from the virus or don’t have to travel far to get vaccinated across a border.\\nA medical worker prepares to administer a vaccine at a drive-through site at the Strawberry Festival Fairgrounds in Plant City, Florida, on 13 January. Photograph: Octavio Jones/Reuters\\nOne New York resident has seen several of her friends and family planning to cross state boundaries for vaccines. “My friend’s mom, a New York resident currently waiting out the pandemic in Florida, is driving to New Jersey for a vaccine in February,” she said. “She has high blood pressure and researched multiple states where she might be eligible for the vaccine and New Jersey fit the bill.”\\nHer sibling, a teacher hoping to safely re-enter the classroom, had since-abandoned plans to travel from New York to New Jersey to get vaccinated under the state’s priority vaccination policy for teachers with pre-existing conditions. “There’s no burden of proof in New Jersey to show that you’re a former smoker, so it’s an easy loophole to exploit,” she said. Another family friend who is over 65 years old and immunocompromised, living in New Jersey, signed up to get the vaccine in New York due to a lack of available appointments in her home state.\\nWolfson said these types of decisions were understandable, though not necessarily commendable, especially given widespread government mismanagement of the pandemic and the human instinct for self-preservation.\\n“When we have limited supplies of a highly in-demand, lifesaving product and people don’t even know how to get it or the phone lines are crowded and the computer signups aren’t working and they sit online at 3 o’clock in the morning at 85 years old waiting for the first dose to come out, that only reduces the amount of trust that people have in this system,” he said.\\n“The more you have inconsistency – with one state saying, ‘We’ll take smokers,’ and other state saying, ‘We’re not going to do prisoners,’ and politicians proudly jumping to the head of the line in many parts of the country – the less support you’re going to have for following the rules,” said Dr Arthur Caplan, a professor of bioethics at the NYU School of Medicine. “There is a little bit of excusable wiggle room for those in high-risk groups trying to protect themselves.”\\nBut vaccine tourists who are able to cross state lines to get vaccinated are largely those with the means and ability to travel a distance – twice – for the vaccine and the technological savvy or connections to claim an appointment. This has contributed to racial and socioeconomic disparities in vaccine distribution so far: from New York to New Jersey to Chicago, vaccine recipients have been overwhelmingly white, residing in wealthier zip codes.\\n“The most important thing is: do not waste vaccines. I much prefer it going into somebody’s arm than a trash can,” said Caplan of the reality that some vaccine doses are going unclaimed at distribution sites across the country. “But we haven’t completed vaccinating healthcare workers and elderly people. So cutting in line in front of people who have greater risk of actually dying, often by people who are younger, can stay at home, quarantine, wear masks and protect themselves, that is to be condemned.”\\nBeyond these individual decisions, however, is a systemic problem, Caplan said. “What happened to the vaccine supply? How come we don’t know how much we got? There has been a huge leadership failure.”\",\n",
       "  \"E\\nngland is back in lockdown. It happened not a moment too soon. As of 2 November almost three-quarters of a million new cases have been officially counted since 21 September, when the government’s scientific advisory committee Sage advised lockdown. On that day, Britain had only had about 360,000 cases since Covid arrived. Now the figure is three times that. So many more cases mean it will take longer, and possibly require tougher social restrictions, to get numbers down by imposing lockdown than it would have in September, says James Naismith, head of the Rosalind Franklin Institute in Oxford.\\nNaismith calculates that we will have 500 deaths per day in two to three weeks because of the cases that occurred over the past week, compared with an average of 144 in the week ending 2 November. But it could be far worse. If we had done nothing for another two weeks, he says, we’d be looking at 1,000 deaths a day by Christmas – and more, if hospitals fill up and not everyone can get optimal treatment.\\n“No one is saying lockdowns are not harmful, they will cause misery and death,” says Naismith. “Being poorer as a country means we will be unhealthier. We know despair and isolation take lives. We know delays in treating some (non-Covid) diseases will increase deaths.” It is clear, however, that Covid-19 is far deadlier, he says.\\nBut beating it back means people must follow the lockdown rules, and more closely than many did in spring. And that will be easier if there is a light at the end of this tunnel.\\nThe brutal truth is that Boris Johnson’s pledge in July that Covid would be “over by Christmas” is as illusory as that promise proved back in the first world war. But we know that places that acted fast and forcefully enough to get infection down to low levels early on, then kept it there, with some distancing but also effective testing, tracing and quarantine, have been able to return to a degree of normality. Life is largely normal in New Zealand; the South Korean test and trace response is widely regarded as the benchmark; Taiwan recently celebrated 200 days without a case; Vietnam hasn’t added to its death count of 35 since 5 September, and China, source of the virus, has so far avoided a second wave.\\nBut given that the UK’s test and trace system is so shambolic, we appear to be relying on a vaccine to bail us out. Sadly, it’s more complicated than that. Even once discovered, manufactured and distributed, it won’t banish the virus immediately, says Prof David Salisbury of Imperial College London, a former director of immunisation at the Department of Health. We will still need some distancing, and testing and quarantine to keep outbreaks under control. But we may not be condemned to the life we’re living now.\\nVaccines\\nA vaccine may not be enough on its own, but it is necessary. It is the only proven way to reach “herd immunity” – when so many of the population (thought to be at least 60% for Covid-19) are immune to the virus that an infected person contacts very few non-immune people and, unable to find new hosts, the virus dies out.\\nTesting for a vaccine in a laboratory in Beijing. Photograph: Thomas Peter/Reuters\\nLetting the virus rip through a population with less immunity – as advocated by the so-called Great Barrington Declaration and others – would kill thousands who would have been saved if we had slowed the spread of the virus before the vaccine arrived, overwhelm the NHS and leave many people dealing with the misery of “long Covid” for years to come.\\nWe will know before the year’s end whether some of the 11 vaccines now in large-scale trials actually work. The US-based firm Pfizer and its partners are among the farthest along the track, partly because their vaccine is made of mRNA that codes for a virus protein, which is quick to produce.\\nPfizer has nearly completed signing up 44,000 people for its vaccine, which requires two jabs three weeks apart. Half will receive a placebo. It hopes that by late November sufficient numbers of the participants will have caught Covid, and significantly fewer of them will have had the vaccine than a placebo. If there are so few that it shows the vaccine made people half as likely to get the disease, the vaccine will meet the minimum level of effectiveness set by the US regulatory agencies. If there are so few that it shows the vaccine protected 77% of recipients, the trial will stop, as it would not be ethical to keep giving people placebo – and approval can get under way.\\nIn documents shared last week the head of the UK vaccine task force Katie Bingham revealed that the plan is to offer a vaccine to all adults over 50 by Easter next year.\\nThen what? Say the first vaccines protect 70% of the people who get them, and 70% of the population is vaccinated – and both of those are ambitious targets. That means 49% of the population will be protected, says David Salisbury. Herd immunity requires more than that. It may even be difficult to vaccinate that many, if side-effects such as fatigue, however mild or temporary, set in after the first jab and some refuse the second.\\nBut current UK vaccination plans don’t aim for herd immunity at first. The most recent advice calls for “targeted” vaccination of people most at risk: frontline workers such as medical staff, and people who are older or have medical conditions such as diabetes, who are most likely to contract severe disease. Vaccinating those people would cut severe cases, deaths and hospital demand, but they don’t number enough to reach herd immunity. “The virus will continue to circulate among younger healthy people, especially if they ignore social distancing and won’t wear masks,” says Salisbury – at least until more people are vaccinated. We will need what he calls “Vaccine Plus”, masks and some distancing, to keep this circulation in check – and stop it reaching the 30% of vaccinated, high-risk people who aren’t protected by the vaccine.\\nA wedding in Seoul, South Korea, in October. Photograph: Jeon Heon-Kyun/EPA\\nMoreover, warns Peter Hotez of Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, the first vaccines might stop vaccinated people getting sick, but not prevent them catching and transmitting the virus. “In that case we’ll still require masks and social distancing, until better vaccines come along,” he says.\\nSome immunologists think that is not all bad. If young children – who do not usually get so sick from Covid as adults – start catching the virus every winter we may develop enough immunity, if not to stop the virus circulating then at least to limit its impact. In a generation, everyone will have had it as children, and Covid will be mild. That may be what happened with the four coronaviruses that now cause common colds in winter. Genetic analysis shows one, OC43, left cattle and entered humans around 1890. It may be what really caused a pandemic that year of what we thought was severe flu, says Nicholas Christakis of Yale University, but which we now realise had Covid-like symptoms.\\nDrugs\\nIn any case, the immediate effect of the vaccine should be fewer people dying but the virus still circulating at some level. This could be easier to face with some effective drugs to tame the sporadic cases.\\nMonoclonal antibodies are artificially made proteins similar to the ones our own immune systems make, but usually too late in the disease to save us. Several are under development, and the monoclonal made by US firm Eli Lilly was used to treat President Trump. Results have been mixed. Trials of the drug in hospitalised Covid patients ended in late October, when no improvements were seen. It is still being tested in less severe cases. One severe-case trial of a cocktail of two monoclonals made by US firm Regeneron has also been halted, although that drug is still being tested in the UK Recovery trial.\\nRecovery has so far mostly tested “re-purposed” drugs already approved to treat other conditions. As these have passed safety trials, they are a fast way to treat a new disease if they turn out to work for that too. So far, Recovery has found that two such hopefuls do not work on Covid: the hydroxychloroquine championed by the White House, and a mix called lopinavir/ritonavir, at least in severe disease.\\nA long-used anti-inflammatory drug, dexamethasone, did turn out to help in late Covid, when most damage is done by runaway inflammation, a reaction of the immune system. Recovery also plans to test tocilizumab, a monoclonal that blocks inflammation. University College London is similarly testing existing antiviral drugs favipiravir and lopinavir/ritonavir early in the disease.\\nWe need to all become South Korea as quickly as possible\\nRecovery is also testing blood serum containing antibodies to Covid from people who have survived it. Paul Morgan of the University of Cardiff has high hopes for drugs that block the over-activation of an immune system called complement, a feature of severe Covid. Preliminary small-scale trials of existing anti-complement drugs in the Netherlands have been promising.\\nThere were several specific anti-coronavirus drugs in the works after the first Sars virus in 2003 that block bits of viral machinery. But Sars was eradicated with tracing and quarantine – it spread more clumsily than Covid. With no market for coronavirus drugs, research funding stopped despite warnings from scientists that the viruses remained a threat. Some researchers are trying to revive these efforts. “We need to develop countermeasures that can keep people from getting severely ill,” says Amesh Adalja of Johns Hopkins University. “I don’t think things will get completely back to normal, if that means to a pre-pandemic level,” he adds. “There will be some social distancing that will have to continue,” at least until a second-generation of vaccines arrives that prevents all transmission.\\nTesting\\nWe also need better diagnostics. Some countries, notably South Korea, used widespread testing early in the pandemic to contain the virus and keep case numbers low. You need low case numbers to track and quarantine everyone infected, and UK numbers are currently too high. But vaccination should drive case numbers down to where containment becomes practicable. “We need to all become South Korea as quickly as possible,” says Joshua Gans of the University of Toronto, author of Economics in the Age of Covid-19.\\nLockdown does economic damage, but he insists there is no trade-off between that and deaths. “There is no point where we can keep the economy humming while people are getting sick in large numbers.” The faster we stop that, the less expensive it will be – and testing can both help contain the virus and allow us to do things like resume work.\\nQueues at a walk-in testing centre in London. Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty Images\\n“Rapid testing should have been brought in months ago,” agrees epidemiologist Tim Sly of Ryerson University in Toronto. “Anyone who deals with the public, from medical staff to taxi drivers, could be required to take a rapid test once a week,” and quarantined with financial support if the test is positive.\\nThe PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests that we currently use are extremely accurate but slow. Rapid tests are less accurate but give almost instantaneous results. One kind (antigen) detects viral proteins, another (Lamp) detects viral RNA. The UK government plans to use all three kinds of tests to screen the half-million people of Liverpool, starting this weekend. The hope is to identify those infected, even without symptoms, and stop them spreading the virus. If it works, the plan is to deploy millions of the rapid tests before Christmas, in what was originally dubbed Operation Moonshot.\\nSlovakia and Chinese cities including Wuhan have already demonstrated that it is possible to conduct such mass testing. It will have little impact on the spread of the virus, however, if those who test positive do not isolate themselves. The rate at which people who test positive isolate in England is as low as 20%.\\nCoronavirus emerging from its cells. Photograph: AP\\nFor now, the plan is to use the tests to snuff out the spread of the virus and get numbers down to manageable levels. But eventually, disease experts envisage using them to enable a return of normal activities, despite the continued low-level circulation of the virus. There is a risk that with many tests, even a small false positive rate could disrupt too many lives needlessly. However, Sly says tests can be nested to improve accuracy. A test that is 90% sensitive will miss 10% of positives. “But two tests five to seven days apart are 99% sensitive at finding you positive – if you actually are.”\\nThis might enable us to begin carefree air travel again. Sly pictures taking a test when you buy the ticket a week before you fly. Then you get tested at the airport, a procedure not much more difficult than some now demanded in airport security. If both are negative, he says, “you board the plane and relax, because you know everyone else has been tested twice in the past week”. That means no catching Covid on the plane, and no quarantine at your destination. Airports in Italy, France and elsewhere are already using rapid tests to detect Covid in arriving passengers.\\nAnother sign of a return to normality would be to hug Gran without fear. Well, Gran will be vaccinated, but that might not mean she is 100% protected. And we might be unknowingly carrying the virus even if we are also vaccinated. Gran might even be carrying it. The chances are lower, but still there. Again, the key is testing.\\nA quiet pint in Liverpool last month. Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images\\nThe sensitivity of rapid tests might be less than the slow lab tests used now, but rapid tests detect people who are actually transmitting the virus, says Michael Mina of Harvard University. He would like them used widely. “Frequent rapid antigen tests can help stop Covid-19 while we await vaccines,” he tweeted last week. “These will help society regain normalcy.”\\nIncluding a trip to the pub. Indoor gatherings might not be maskless for the foreseeable future, and some spacing might remain advisable. But even that may not be needed with widespread, self-administered rapid antigen tests, which will enable us to check if we pose a risk. Gans argues that trusting people to be truthful about these is no riskier than trusting people to monitor their symptoms, as we do now. Others may look at some individuals’ attitudes to masks and distancing and be less convinced.\\nAnthony Fauci told the BBC last week: “With a successful vaccine, and the continuation of some form of public health measures, as we progress through the months of 2021, getting towards the third and fourth quarter, we will see a considerable approach towards some form of normality.”\\nDisease experts don't think Covid-19 is a one-off, or that it will be long before we see another pandemic\\nMeanwhile, what we are learning while fighting Covid, adds Johns Hopkins’s Adalja, “could make us much more resilient to the next pandemic threat we face.”. Disease experts don’t think Covid-19 is a one-off, or that it will be long before we see another pandemic. A flu pandemic is an ever-present threat, and other viruses in wild animals worry researchers. If nothing else, there are other coronaviruses in bats that could jump species, that could be more lethal than Covid-19, and different enough to present us with a whole new fight.\\nIt is a fight we will be far more ready for if we don’t forget the lessons we are learning now. If wearing masks a bit longer helps drive those lessons home, that may not be a bad thing.\\nBut humans are highly adaptable, and normality is a movable feast. This time next year you may be having dreams about having somehow, inexplicably, left home without a mask – and everyone is pointing and staring. You make sure you grab one as you do your daily home test for Covid and a few other viruses, and head out to meet Gran down the pub, to give her the sherry you brought her from Spain.\\nDebora MacKenzie is the author of Covid-19: The Pandemic That Never Should Have Never Happened, and How to Stop the Next One (Little, Brown £18.99).

       "  \"M\\nillions of Californians on Thursday became eligible to get the Covid-19 vaccine as the state expanded eligibility to residents over the age of 50. But throughout the day, hundreds of people reported being unable to sign up for vaccine slots online.\\n“There are NO appointments,” one Santa Clara resident tweeted. Other tweets read: “No appointments within 100 miles of San Francisco,” and “Is California’s new slogan ‘Perpetually behind’?”\\nThursday’s problems didn’t come as a surprise. Despite its reputation as the world’s technology capital, California has struggled to develop a smooth process for Covid-19 vaccine sign-ups. At the top of Californians’ long list of complaints about vaccine distribution is My Turn, the website launched by the state as a hub for scheduling.\\nSince its launch in January, the system has struggled with glitches. The website often crashes, sometimes doesn’t show any appointments at all, lists appointments that do not actually exist, or at times allows users to sign up for a first vaccine dose but not for the second.\\nPfizer finds Covid vaccine safe and effective for children 12 to 15\\nRead more\\nIn addition to those technological hurdles, experts say My Turn’s more systemic failures represent an amalgam of California’s vaccination challenges. The site has been slow to catch up with the state’s ever-changing eligibility guidelines; it’s one of many systems in a fragmented distribution network; and it isn’t effective at prioritizing those most in need, despite state assurances that equity would drive the vaccination campaign.\\n“This is about decisions being made in [the state capital] Sacramento by people who have no direct relationship with our community and tried to impose a computer system that does not work on the whole state,” said Rebecca Kaplan, Oakland council member at large, who sits on the taskforce coordinating mass vaccination in the city.\\nA continued indictment\\nGovernor Gavin Newsom himself marked the expansion of the state’s vaccine eligibility criteria on Thursday, receiving a Johnson & Johnson shot at a vaccine site in a Los Angeles mall-turned-vaccination site, as members of the media watched.\\nGavin Newsom takes questions from the media on the day he received his vaccine. Photograph: Damian Dovarganes/AP\\nBut just like other times during the vaccination campaign when California expanded qualifications, sign-ups for the jabs did not go smoothly for everyone.\\nIn fact, Thursday’s sign-up problems marked a continued indictment of the system meant to save California’s floundering vaccine rollout. My Turn first emerged as a pilot at the end of January to help users determine their eligibility for a vaccine, be alerted when they qualify, and sign up for one once they do. The launch came at fraught time for Newsom.\\nCalifornia at the time ranked worst in the country in terms of how many vaccines had been administered. Residents were fuming over school closures and ever-changing lockdown regulations. Newsom had drawn ire for a maskless appearance at a fine dining establishment while the rest of the state was under order to avoid indoor dining. A recall effort was looming.\\nThe website’s development took just 10 days and was helmed by the California departments of public health and technology and built by the local tech giant Salesforce. The system debuted in select cities and was held up as an option for counties that had struggled to set up their own websites.\\nBut after the private insurance provider Blue Shield signed an opaque $15m contract to take over California’s snail-paced vaccine rollout, Newsom announced My Turn use would become mandatory at the end of March. Counties and healthcare providers involved in distribution were up in arms and refused to switch over.\\nProviders complained that turning to the new system while some patients were between first and second doses needlessly complicated the vast undertaking.\\nExperts warned the criteria for eligibility on the My Turn site sometimes diverged from specific county rules and were not always updated after the state made changes in its eligibility criteria.\\n“Part of accessibility is making sure that My Turn is up to date with who is eligible to get a vaccine and where they can get one,” said Bernadette Boden-Albala, the dean of UC Irvine’s public health program. “There is a huge disconnect there that I think is very, very problematic.”\\nGlitches exacerbate ‘existing equity issues’\\nThe technology failures are more than just an inconvenience, public health experts say; they also prevent some of the most vulnerable populations from getting vaccines.\\n“The most significant problem we are having in California with the vaccine rollout is that glitches with My Turn are exacerbating existing equity issues,” said Shira Shafir, assistant professor of epidemiology and community health sciences at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health.\\nWith My Turn, counties and medical providers all operating sign-up systems in tandem, technologically savvy residents and those with the time and computer access needed to refresh sign-up pages repeatedly have been more easily able to access appointments, said Shafir.\\n“While we want everybody to get an appointment and get vaccinated as soon as it’s their turn, what we’re seeing is a massive divide between those who have the ability to navigate through the platform to find their appointment and those who do not,” Shafir said.\\nIn addition, several counties and providers argued the system was ill equipped to target vaccines to the most vulnerable communities, despite that being a stated goal of the government.\\nKaplan in Oakland said the My Turn system did not, for example, allow vaccine availability targeting by zip code, which would allow neighborhoods hardest hit by the pandemic to be prioritized.\\nA health worker prepares the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine in Morgan Hill, California. Photograph: John G Mabanglo/EPA\\nShe argued that those systemic failures were far more consequential than sporadic, yet widely reported, incidents of privileged Californians skipping the line by using sign-up codes meant for low-income residents. “Those are a small fraction of the problem compared to the fact that the core system has been programmed to allow exactly that kind of inequity to happen,” she said.\\nNewsom vowed to change the system several weeks ago but it remained impossible within the system to set aside vaccines for certain communities, she said. “We are in the technology capital of the world and you are telling me we can’t fix these issues with My Turn?”\\n'I can’t wait to hug my daughter': how it feels to finally get the vaccine\\nRead more\\nNewsom’s office and Blue Shield referred the Guardian to the California public health department for questions related to My Turn. .\\nDarrel Ng, a spokesman for the department, said My Turn was continually working to improve vaccine outcomes for Californians, and that many of the problems with booking appointments had more to do with vaccine supply than the website itself.\\nMy Turn, Ng said, was an effort to get all the counties in the state on the same page after some struggled to get residents to sign up using a mix of low-tech and glitchy options. “We will admit that it does require some investment from providers to switch to a new system, but we think serving the people of California during a pandemic is worth that investment,” he said.\\nNg said the state on 4 March made a renewed effort to address vaccine equity and My Turn since then released an increased percentage of vaccines to residents of the hardest-hit areas of the state. Meanwhile, the state has continued to provided sign-up codes to specific healthcare providers in those areas to distribute to their patients, he said.\\n“We are working to reduce as many barriers as possible to the hardest-hit communities getting vaccinated,” he said.\\nHe also noted that California has now distributed 76.6% of its vaccine supply, which is about the national average. The state is now number 31 out of 50 in terms of distribution percentiles, according to Becker’s Hospital Review.\\n‘My Turn is just not where it needs to be’\\nAll but one of the state’s 58 counties initially declined to contract with BlueShield. In recent weeks, with the eligibility expansion on the horizon, BlueShield and several counties have come to agreements that allow them to keep their own sign-up systems and incorporate their own local planning into the rollout – including keeping control of prioritization of certain communities and manners of distribution.\\nBut still, only 38 of 61 local health jurisdictions, representing 82% of the population, have signed on so far, according to the public health department.\\nAnd even then, Boden-Albala said, much time had been lost.\\n“I understand there are a lot of challenges,” she said. “But My Turn is just not where it needs to be given how far we are into this vaccine campaign.\\n“The vaccine distribution under this third-party administration is still a mess, and the transition is not transparent,” she said. “It is amazing to me as someone trained in public health that we were not planning our vaccine distribution over the past year.”\",\n",
       "  'Japan was among the first countries to report cases of Covid-19 after the world was alerted to the virus in December 2019. But just over a year later, it is the last major economy to deploy a vaccine – a measure widely acknowledged as the best hope for a return to something resembling normal life.\\nThe first round of jabs is not expected to begin in Japan until the end of February, months after the US and UK – which have recorded far higher death tolls and caseloads – began their vaccination programmes.\\nOn explaining the apparent lack of urgency, officials have pointed to Japan’s relative success in averting a catastrophic outbreak, with 373,000 cases and 5,300 deaths recorded to date.\\nBut getting the vaccine into arms has also been delayed by clinical trials involving Japanese people that must be completed before it can be approved, and a history of vaccine hesitancy among large sections of the public.\\nAccording to the health ministry, as many as 20,000 frontline health workers will be the first to get vaccinated late next month, followed by other medical personnel and 36 million people aged over 65 from around April.\\nPeople with pre-existing conditions, care home staff and those aged 60 to 64 will be immunised from June, the ministry has said, but it gave no details for people aged between 16 and 60.\\n“I don’t think the vaccination programme is too slow,” said Masayuki Miyasaka, a professor emeritus of immunology at Osaka University. “It gives us sufficient time to take a close look at the frequency and nature of vaccine-induced adverse reactions overseas. Since mRNA vaccines [such as those developed by Pfizer and Moderna] are new to us, we should pay good attention to the possible health hazards induced by the vaccination.”\\nA doctor inspects a man participating in a Covid vaccination drill at the Kawasaki City College of Nursing.

A combined inoculation for measles and rubella is part of the national immunisation programme but parents must pay for their child to be protected against mumps.\\nAnd after some recipients of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine complained of severe side-effects, the government stopped actively recommending the shots in 2013.\\nThat decision, which studies say could lead to thousands of preventable deaths from cervical cancer, sent vaccination rates plummeting from 70% to less than 1%.\\nThe media-fuelled controversies over the MMR and HPV jabs, which are both recommended by the World Health Organization, have left many Japanese wary about the safety of Covid vaccines.\\nHalf of the respondents to a recent poll by the public broadcaster NHK said they wanted to be immunised against Covid-19, but 38% said they did not intend to have the vaccine.\\nIn a Lancet study of 149 countries published in September, Japan ranked among the lowest in vaccine confidence, with fewer than 25% of people agreeing on vaccine safety, importance and effectiveness.\\nVaccinating significant numbers of people by the time the Olympics are due to open on 23 July will involve an unprecedented effort by an understaffed healthcare system that is already struggling to cope with a recent influx of Covid patients.\\nA manager at fridge manufacturer Kanou Reiki checks deep freezers that will be used to store Covid vaccines at the company’s warehouse in Sagamihara, Kanagawa prefecture.

That would require 870,000 injections a day, with each person requiring two inoculations.\\nMiyasaka, who acknowledged the government had adopted an “extremely cautious” approach due to the MMR and HPV controversies, said bureaucratic turf wars were partly to blame for the delay.\\n“Our government is just not properly organised,” he said, adding that it could take at least another six months to cover a large proportion of the Japanese population. “A number of ministries are involved in vaccinations, and they tend to operate independently of one another.”\\nThere are concerns, too, about a possible shortage of specialised containers to transport the Pfizer vaccine, which has to be stored at -75C.\\n“The government’s plan puts a big burden on the individual municipalities in giving out the vaccines,” said Koji Wada, an adviser to the government on its Covid response. “The big metropolitan areas like Tokyo may have the infrastructure to roll out the vaccinations smoothly, but more rural areas could have more difficulty.”\\nWith Reuters',\n",

The fortysomething Los Angeles resident had gotten a hot tip from a friend that there were often dozens of doses of Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine left over at night. Concerned he wouldn’t get a chance to make an appointment to be vaccinated for months, he approached the injection tents as the sky turned dusky, to ask if they had any spares.\\nLos Angeles is vaccinating healthcare workers, first responders and residents older than 65.

Photograph: Jae C Hong/AP\\nIt’s hard to put a number on how many people are scoring vaccine doses ahead of schedule, but it could be a few dozen each day at each of the six mega sites scattered around the 500 square miles of Los Angeles county.\\nThat there are vaccines left over at all is due to several factors. About 10% of people with appointments do not show up for their shot, according to press reports. Vials containing the Moderna vaccine have to be used within six hours after opening before they have to be thrown out. And while vials are supposed to contain five doses, injectors can often coax six doses out of them.\\nIn a mid-January statement, Los Angeles county said its department of public health “does not condone wasting of any precious vaccine doses and has not and is not directing providers to throw away unused doses”. The statement added that the county was moving to set up vaccine clinics on quick turnaround whenever it learned of potential vaccine expirations. (The county public health department did not respond to requests for comment for this story.)\\nDr Monya De, an LA-area physician who volunteered at the Inglewood Forum, which is one of six mega sites for vaccine dispersal in LA county, said some family members accompanying seniors to get their shot asked if there were any available for them as well. “Our instructions are to vaccinate only the person who was registered,” she said. “It’s a volume issue: we have a large volume of people in LA who need to get vaccinated.”\\nBut De said she did wonder about resource allocation and if the current approach is the best way to get the most needles in the most arms. “I could see potentially the instruction being changed to: yes, if you have an extra vaccine you can inject people who are coming along in the same family.”\\nAt the end of her recent shift, De and the other injectors circled the Forum to get an accurate count of how much vaccine was left. They then got the go-ahead from the site administration to summon people who could quickly drive over for the extra doses. “We heard at least one person saying, ‘I think we’re going to throw some of this away,’” she recalled. “That was really concerning.”\\nSome of the volunteers knew people who could get there quickly, and soon a flurry of calls and texts went out. The volunteers’ friends and family began to arrive. No vaccine was thrown away that day.\\nDrivers wait in line at the mass Covid-19 vaccination site in the parking lot of Dodger Stadium.

They’ll have to walk up to receive their second dose in three or four weeks, though some walk-ups will receive emails to schedule their second shot with an official appointment.\\nDouglas, who asked to use a pseudonym, did not want to get in the way when he went searching for a shot. There was no formal line at the Inglewood forum that evening, just a few people walking up, sitting in chairs, and receiving injections. He watched them take selfies, feeling awkward and envious. As he hovered nearby, waiting for an opening, the manager of the site soon closed it down. “No more doses today.” Douglas walked back into the dusky evening, wondering if he should try again.\\nHe spent the next day debating, wondering if he should visit the vaccine site again. Eventually, he decided to try once more, arriving just after the official appointments ended. He crossed the dark parking lot and walked toward the injection tents, asking a few people and waiting. That day, his fortune changed. “It’s your lucky day,” one volunteer told him, leading him to the spot where he would get his shot. But there was a catch, and a request: the site can’t handle a crush of people arriving without appointments. “Please don’t post this on social media.”',\n",
       "  \"Anna Davidson laughs down the phone when asked how the Covid-19 vaccine rollout is going at her clinic in Port Stephens, in New South Wales’s Hunter region.\\nThen she asks if she can beat her head against the wall.\\nIn a frenetic 10-day period last month, her clinic spent $25,000 transforming itself into a potential Covid-19 vaccination powerhouse for the region.\\nThe clinic’s staff bought new specialised vaccine fridges, pushed through a wall to expand space for vaccine patients, organised more nurses, more support staff, and drew up flow charts and detailed maps to ensure adequate social distancing and a proper post-jab supervision space.\\nThey prepared modelling on demand – factoring in local population, demographics and the likelihood of other clinics participating – and estimated they could give 500 doses per day or 1,000 doses per day if needed, and even more if the rules allowed them to coordinate with other nearby GPs.\\nAustralia's Covid vaccine rollout would be 'dire' without local AstraZeneca production, health chief says\\nRead more\\nAt the end of all that work, the Nelson Plaza Clinic received a letter from the government.\\n“They say ‘congratulations, you can have 50 vaccines a week’,” Davidson says. “We are already set up to easily do in excess of 2,500 vaccines per week, and we were ready to expand to over 5,000 vaccines per week if we were needed.”\\nShe was gobsmacked. It would leave each of the clinic’s 11 GPs administering just four-and-a-half vaccines per week.\\n“I think that’s bad, except then we find out that it’s not 50 vaccines a week. Because of the way the overseas vaccines have been packaged, we only get 40 vaccines per week.”\\n“And I’m just like ‘can I beat my head against a wall?’.”\\nDavidson’s frustrations are not unique. GPs across the country, already fatigued from the strain placed on them during the pandemic, have seethed with frustration in the past two weeks, as the government moved to the second stage of its vaccine rollout, phase 1b.\\nIn phase 1b Australians over 70, Indigenous Australians over 55, those with pre-existing medical conditions, and some healthcare workers, are due to be vaccinated, largely through about 4,000 GP clinics, 100 commonwealth-run respiratory clinics, and Aboriginal health centres.\\nThe frustration began last Wednesday, when the government blindsided many GPs by publicly telling Australians to flock to a new government website, which checked their eligibility for the vaccine and then linked roughly 6 million eligible patients with about 1,000 GP clinics currently activated to distribute the vaccine.\\nGPs were immediately inundated with calls. With no vaccine supply to speak of, most simply could not book patients in.\\n“I know practices that fielded 1,000 phone calls on that day. Our phones, we didn’t count them so I couldn’t tell you how many,” Davidson says. “But the amount of time and money that it cost for us just to explain to every patient that ‘I’m sorry, we can’t book you in’, ‘I’m sorry we don’t have any vaccine’.”\\nEven where shipments were promised last week, before the start of phase 1b on Monday, some simply didn’t show up.\\nGovernment correspondence obtained by the Guardian shows that, in some areas, there were “significant” delivery failures. In some cases, vaccines were showing up, but needles and disposal containers were not.\\nOther deliveries were delayed by the New South Wales floods.\\nMukesh Haikerwal, a Melbourne-based GP and former president of the Australian Medical Association, was inundated with calls well before his clinic received any doses.\\n“The switchboard turned red again today,” he told the Guardian last Thursday. “It has just not stopped. Every time you put it down, another two come in.\\n“The message has to be that … we’ve got to do it in order, we’ve got to have vaccinations to do it. To say that 4 million people will be done on Monday, which is currently the message that went out, really wasn’t helpful to anybody.”\\nThe huge demand was further compounded by problems with both the government’s website and private booking websites.\\nThe flawed design of the government’s website suggested to some regional residents that they would have to drive hours, in some cases across state borders, to reach a participating GP clinic. In Tasmania, some residents were being told that one of their closest clinics was on the mainland.\\nA screenshot from the government’s vaccination booking website showing the closest Covid-19 vaccination clinics for Katherine, Northern Territory.

The site allowed users to book in for second doses within days of the first, despite government recommendations that a three-month gap was needed to give greatest efficacy.\\nThere is no doubt that the vaccine rollout is one of the most complex, logistically challenging undertakings that has faced the Australian government.\\nIt has been complicated further still by factors outside of the government’s control.

The supply countries are still contractually obliged to us and, and they may deliver, but we’re not counting on it.”\\nRegardless of the international constraints, there have been clear errors in Australia’s rollout.\\nOne GP clinic, the Claremont Village medical centre, had specifically instructed the health department it did not want to be listed as a vaccination centre.\\nIt was listed in error anyway.\\n“How does that error occur?” Labor senator Anne Urquhart asked in Senate estimates this week.\\nThe associate health department secretary, Caroline Edwards, responded: “It’s a huge program, senator.”\\nThe government has rejected suggestions that it rushed the announcement of the website, or that GP clinics were blindsided.\\n“Every GP practice knew that participating practices would be displayed in the clinic finder,” Murphy told Senate estimates this week.\\nThe complaint from many GPs, though, was about the way the government communicated with the public.

       "  'Studies in Israel have offered tentative optimism on the effectiveness of vaccines in curbing the coronavirus pandemic, with initial data suggesting even the early stages of inoculation campaigns might have marked decreases in both hospital cases and infections.\\nWith one in three Israelis having received at least one shot, a far higher fraction than anywhere else, the country of 9 million people provides a test case for the worldwide vaccine push.\\nThe state’s 24/7 campaign has meant many vulnerable populations, including about 70% of over-60s, have already received the prescribed two doses of the Pfizer/BioNtech vaccine. The country is injecting up to 200,000 people a day, and last week made the jab available to anyone over 35. Secondary school students aged 16 to 18 are also included, in the hopes of allowing them to sit exams.\\nIsrael’s health ministry released its first official results last week, showing that only 317 out of 715,425, or 0.04%, of people became infected a week after becoming fully vaccinated against the disease – the time when increased immunity is expected to kick in. Of the vaccinated people who were infected, 16 had to be treated in hospital, or 0.002% of the total.\\nOne domestic healthcare provider, Maccabi Healthcare Services, released an encouraging smaller study on Thursday. It revealed that out of 163,000 Israelis given both shots, only 31 were infected, compared with nearly 6,500 infections among a control group of unvaccinated people.\\nMaccabi said the data suggested the vaccine was 92% effective, close to the 95% efficacy that Pfizer claims. “This is very, very good news,” Dr Anat Ekka Zohar, the vice-president of Maccabi, told local media.\\nIsrael’s government has capitalised on its ability to run a rapid vaccination campaign, and analyse its impact on infections in real time, to persuade Pfizer to keep it steadily supplied with doses.\\nEarlier this month, the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said he had secured a commitment from the pharmaceutical company to bring forward deliveries in return for Israel providing “statistical data” – in effect making the country a mass test case to see how vaccines might halt the pandemic.\\nThe country hopes to have vaccinated all over-16s by the end of March, and possibly earlier. Experts have said, however, that data from Israel is preliminary and could be misleading. With its vast variables and constantly changing scenarios, an entire society cannot act as a petri dish for a vaccine trial, they say.\\n“When you vaccinate nationwide, there’s lots of confounders,” said Eran Segal, a computational biologist at the Weizmann Institute. “This is not a trial. That’s the problem. We should be very cautious.”\\nIsrael is up against a debilitating third wave of infections, with a national lockdown unable to significantly push down death rates. The government blames high infection rates on the more transmissible British variant of the virus. There has also been local resentment towards certain sections of the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community that have defied lockdown rules.\\nYoav Kisch, the deputy health minister, said on Sunday there would be “a few weeks’ delay” to a national plan to reopen the economy, previously envisioned for early February.\\nVaccine data could be influenced by both the lockdown, which may decrease infections, and the British variant, which likely has the opposite effect, in confusing and contrasting ways.\\nMeanwhile, the first people to receive the vaccine mostly come from vulnerable populations, who may have been more likely to take precautions, which also could skew the data. Preliminary research might show different results at different times as the number of people being vaccinated is continually changing, and hospitalisation usually occurs days after infection.\\nAn intense global focus on signals from Israel has already led to controversy. Several million Palestinians living under Israeli occupation have not been vaccinated. On Sunday, Israel’s defence ministry said it had agreed to send 5,000 doses to immunise frontline Palestinian medical workers, a move that followed international pressure.\\nSeparately, earlier this month, the country’s “coronavirus tsar” raised concerns that one shot of the Pfizer vaccine might be less effective than originally thought. The comments made news in the UK, where the government faces concerns that a policy to delay administering their second doses could backfire. However, Israel’s health ministry later said the comments had been taken out of context.\\nLast week’s health ministry figures may provide further concern for the UK policy. It showed that 42% of Israel’s 834 critically ill patients had already received one shot of the Pfizer vaccine. That figure dropped to 2% after the second jab.\\nWhile acknowledging the limitations of data coming out of Israel, Segal does see possible hope in one potential indicator – the percentage of people over 60 who have become critically ill. As a fraction of the total population, that group, which has largely been vaccinated, is decreasing, a trend not seen during previous lockdowns when inoculations were unavailable.\\n“There are definitely some positive indications,” he said. “We should begin to see numbers going down, both critically ill and infections. Definitely the critically ill.”',\n",

It is a lottery on an unprecedented scale.\\nThey have rolled the dice and cannot know whether the gamble will pay off. Earlier this week, the frontrunner the UK and EU have ordered, the Oxford University-AstraZeneca vaccine, was paused after a volunteer became ill. It may not be vaccine-related, but such things can happen.\\nAnd if the wealthy nations lose their bets, they will be knocking on the door of Covax, a World Health Organization initiative set up so that all countries share the risks of vaccine development but also the benefits when one or more emerge that work.\\nThere are an extraordinary 321 potential vaccines in development around the world, of which 32 are in clinical trials, according to the Wellcome Trust. A handful are in their last stages, involving tens of thousands of people.\\nApart from the Oxford vaccine, the UK is gambling on vaccines developed by BioNTech-Pfizer, Valneva, GSK-Sanofi, Novavax and Janssen.\\nIt has spread its bets, ordering vaccines made with four different technologies. But, says Sir Jeremy Farrar, the director of Wellcome, “we have no idea where the best vaccine that is safe and effective will come from.\\n“It is an inherently risky endeavour, and you cannot back on a single vaccine candidate. You have to have a portfolio, you have to be pragmatic that not all of these vaccines in late stage development will make it through.”\\nCovid vaccine tracker: when will a coronavirus vaccine be ready?\\nRead more\\nThe world’s biggest portfolio is held by Covax, which offers a lifeline to poorer countries that could not possibly afford to buy new vaccines for their populations. For wealthy countries Covax is an “insurance policy”.\\nUnicef procures existing vaccines for low-income countries around the world. The United Nations children’s charity is playing a similar role in the Covid-19 pandemic. It is ordering not only potential vaccines, but essentials such as vials, syringes and fridges to be sure there are enough stockpiled before the global rush.\\nGian Gandhi, who is Unicef’s Covax coordinator, said the only country likely to have anything close to the WHO initiative’s large portfolio of potential vaccines and related products was the US.\\n“But what that means is that any other country with a bilateral deal would likely still benefit from signing up to Covax because we don’t know which candidates will show efficacy, be licensed and be recommended for use,” he said. “As a result, the Covax facility could operate as a kind of backup … a kind of insurance policy for the country should the vaccines they have backed not demonstrate efficacy.”\\nSo far, 78 wealthy countries have signed up for the insurance policy, including the UK. The deal is that they put money into Covax, which goes to vaccine developers that sign up to supply the initiative. Wealthy countries still get to self-fund, as Gandhi puts it.\\nCovax will enable developed nations to do a deal for a vaccine that works, if the ones they gambled on fail. But they will have to pay full price for it, unlike 92 low-income countries, which will be subsidised by Gavi, the global alliance for vaccines and immunisation.\\nIn June, Gavi launched an advance market commitment that has raised $600m so far from donors. But it needs $2bn by the end of the year.\\nCovid world map: which countries have the most Coronavirus cases and deaths?\\nRead more\\nIn a pandemic where countries are pulling up drawbridges and being condemned for “vaccine nationalism”, the Covax model is remarkable because it is about equity between wealthy and poor. Every country that has signed up – the US has not – will receive enough vaccine for 20% of its population, the idea being that it will go to health workers and the most vulnerable.\\nDr Melanie Saville, the director of vaccine research and development at the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness (Cepi), believes wealthier countries do want to help end the pandemic in the poorer nations too.\\n“We have to recognise that indeed countries have done bilateral deals with individual manufacturers,” she said. “I think it’s normal for governments to want to protect their own populations. But also we do see that governments are looking to protect the world against Covid-19.”\\nCepi is investing in nine vaccines, which are part of the Covax portfolio and include many of the current contenders, including the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and the vaccine being developed by the US biotech firm Moderna. Cepi has so far invested $1.4bn to support the development of these vaccines, but says a further $1bn is urgently needed.\\nAstraZeneca and Novavax have signed up to allow the Serum Institute of India to make up to 100m doses of their vaccines, if they are successful, that will be distributed through Covax. AstraZeneca has also guaranteed a further 300m doses for Covax.\\nFarrar says no country can immunise everyone of straight away. “I think it’s increasingly clear that most countries do not envisage vaccinating their whole population. I think that’s entirely appropriate for all sorts of different reasons. We wouldn’t have necessarily the doses,” he said.\\nNo manufacturer will have the capacity to churn out all the doses needed – so how we share out the limited stocks of a vaccine over the first six months will be crucial, as will the targeting of people most at risk, Farrar added.\\nBut, the sobering truth remains that a vaccine will not bring an end to the pandemic.\\nAccording to Gavi, vaccines at the preclinical stage – before they are given to humans – have roughly a 7% chance of succeeding, while the ones that make it to clinical trials have about a 20% chance.\\nEven those that succeed will not work perfectly. Few experts think we will have a vaccine that is 100% protective. Some may work better in some people than others. Flu vaccine, for example, does not work well in older people whose immune systems have become weaker with age.\\nIt is also quite possible that some vaccines will need boosting. Antibodies generated by Covid infection have been found to fade in many people, sometimes disappearing within months.\\nBut vaccines, such as the Oxford prototype, which are made with an adenovirus vector – a common cold virus that delivers the Covid vaccine itself – may not be easy to boost.\\nThe immune system could recognise the cold virus and fight it off next time. That means a combination of vaccines may be needed.\\nAnother issue is the need for ultra-low temperatures to store some of the vaccines in development – especially those using messenger RNA.\\n“There are a few vaccines that right now in the clinical trials seem to suggest ultra cold chain, requiring storage at temperatures anywhere between -60C to -80C,” said Gandhi. That is a headache, because those sorts of freezers are not available in most Covax countries.\\nIn the end, says the WHO, the pandemic will be brought to a halt only if all countries can stop the virus circulating.\\n“Equal access to a Covid-19 vaccine is the key to beating the virus and paving the way for recovery from the pandemic,” said Stefan Löfven, Sweden’s prime minister. “This cannot be a race with a few winners.”',\n",

More than 60% of UK respondents were very or somewhat satisfied with Britain’s speedy vaccination campaign, compared with only 31% in France, where the rollout is among the EU’s slowest.\\nHowever, in the Netherlands – which has so far administered at least one dose to just 1.8% of the population, also well below the European average, but where vaccine acceptance is relatively high and trust in central government relatively strong – 58% of people said they were satisfied with the national vaccination campaign.\\nAcross all seven countries – France, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, India, the UK and the US – family doctors and national health authorities were seen as much more reliable sources of information on vaccines, at 39% and 41% respectively.\\nEmmanuel Rivière, Kantar’s director of international polling, said the study revealed the scale of the communications effort some governments will need to make if they hope to improve vaccine acceptance.\\n“Vaccine hesitancy remains for large minorities in France, Germany and the US, where citizens can be twice or three times as likely to trust their family doctor as they are central government,” Rivière said. “This will clearly need to be reflected in governments’ campaigns.”\\nThe popularity of national governments in Europe was unlikely to be affected by the slow pace of vaccination programmes as long as Covid-19 restrictions were in place across the continent, he said. “But if countries that have vaccinated fast start returning to normal sooner, governments could pay a price,” he said.\\nUK passes 10m Covid vaccination milestone\\nRead more\\nSocial media was not widely seen as a reliable source of information on vaccines, with only 5% of respondents in Germany and 4% in Italy and the Netherlands saying they trusted vaccine claims on social networks – although India was a significant exception at 26%.\\nThe study also showed that men are generally more likely to accept vaccination, with 74% saying they would definitely or probably get vaccinated against 69% of women, and that vaccine hesitancy is more acute in some younger age groups.\\nMore than half of French 25- to 34-year-olds, and one third of Dutch 25- to 34-year-olds, said they would definitely or probably not get vaccinated, while across the seven countries only 32% of 18- to 24-year-olds said they would definitely get vaccinated.\\nAcross all countries, health concerns were cited as the main factor in vaccine hesitancy: nearly half of respondents who said they were unlikely to get vaccinated said they were concerned by safety, while 29% said they would like more information.',\n",
       "  'Desperate to return to pre-pandemic normality, many countries where vaccination campaigns for Covid-19 are in full swing are considering endorsing “vaccine passports” to reignite international travel and reopen economies.\\nA week ago, the UK government ruled out plans for such passports – with vaccine minister Nadhim Zahawi calling them “discriminatory” – but on Sunday, the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said the documents were “under consideration”. Labour politicians have advocated their introduction, with the former prime minister Tony Blair making the case for domestic vaccine passports in this week’s Mail on Sunday. So what are the pros and cons of such “immunity certificates”?\\nThe arguments for\\nIncentive They could serve as a powerful motivation for people to get vaccinated. However, David Archard, the chair of the Nuffield Council on Bioethics, argues that they are not necessarily a proportionate way to achieve vaccine compliance, which can be better secured by providing greater and more accurate information to people.\\nOpportunities By getting a certificate, some individuals who have been deprived of access to certain work opportunities by the pandemic could benefit. “And that’s important,” says Archard. “After all, what we’ve dealt with for the last year are considerable restrictions on the freedoms of the population, and here’s one way in which individuals might now be able to get back those basic freedoms that are greatly valuable to them.”\\nTravel The passports could also offer value in terms of international travel – being vaccinated means you will be unlikely to suffer from severe Covid-19 disease that might require hospitalisation abroad. Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, says that if a country’s hospitals are already grappling with high levels of Covid-19, “they don’t want people coming out on holiday from Britain, and then going down with Covid and adding to the burden on their health services. [If you are vaccinated,] you are unlikely to get sick with Covid-19 while you are there, either [because] you brought it into the country or [because] you picked it up in the first week of the holiday.”\\nThe arguments against\\nScience While the vaccines being deployed have shown to have impressive efficacy in reducing the risk of hospitalisation and death for symptomatic Covid-19, at this point there is no concrete evidence that they can thwart transmission, scientists say. “So there is a danger of simply assuming because you’ve been vaccinated, you don’t then spread Covid-19, and that would not be a good scientific basis for a policy of passports,” Archard says.\\nVariants Most countries are in the early stages of the vaccine rollout, and given concerns about the impact of existing variants – in particular the one discovered in South Africa – on the ability of vaccines to offer protection, it would be premature to introduce the passport system, says Archard. “I think we’re about halfway through the first half, and we don’t want to start introducing red and yellow cards quite yet. We want to head on into the second half and see if we can see how it’s working.”\\nDiscrimination Such passports will be used to give people who are vaccinated and presumed to have immunity the ability to do things that others cannot. Given that the vaccine rollout is based on a priority system, some people will be vaccinated before others. Others who choose not to get vaccinated despite being offered the vaccine may also lose out on opportunities. There is a danger of stigmatising individuals who lack certification, and Archard suggests you may also penalise people who are already at a disadvantage because of certain inequalities.\\nFraud The passports could encourage people who have not been vaccinated yet or have chosen not to be vaccinated to get certification on the black market, according to Hunter. So if passports are adopted, he says, “it has to be done in a way that is not subject to fraud”.\\nPrivacy Typically, health information such as vaccination records is stored by the NHS. These passports could mean that data is shared with outside companies, says Archard. “Could it be used in ways that are unfair, that are stigmatising, and that are prejudicial to the interests of individuals? Exactly how it is put into practical effect would also raise reasonable ethical concerns that would need to be addressed.”',\n",
       "  'W\\nhen will we have a Covid-19 vaccine? Public-facing scientists such as the UK’s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, and his US counterpart, Anthony Fauci, keep repeating that it won’t be before 12 to 18 months. But other voices – including some of those in the race to create a vaccine themselves – have suggested that it could be as early as June. Who is right?\\nThe former, probably, but it’s complicated because this pandemic is forcing change at almost every step in the process by which a new vaccine arrives at a needle near us.\\n“It really depends on what you mean by ‘having a vaccine’,” says Marian Wentworth, president and CEO of Management Sciences for Health, a Massachusetts-based global not-for-profit organisation that seeks to build resilient health systems, and a long-time observer of vaccine development. “If you mean one that can be used in a mass vaccination campaign, allowing us all to get on with our lives, then 12 to 18 months is probably right.”\\nBut in terms of an experimental vaccine that is deemed safe and effective enough to be rolled out in a more limited way – to high-risk groups such as health workers, say – that could be ready within weeks or months, under emergency rules developed by drug regulatory agencies and the World Health Organization in the context of the recent Ebola epidemics in Africa.\\nWhen the University of Oxford’s Adrian Hill told the Guardian that his group’s Covid-19 vaccine candidate could be ready by the summer, it was this kind of readiness to which he was probably referring. The group, led by Sarah Gilbert, has since stated that a vaccine shown to be effective in phase-3 clinical trials that could be manufactured in large quantities won’t be ready before the autumn even in a best-case scenario. And that scenario is “highly ambitious and subject to change”.\\nNormally, a vaccine is developed in the lab before being tested on animals. If it proves safe and generates a promising immune response in this pre-clinical phase, it enters human or clinical trials. These are divided into three phases, each of which takes longer and involves more people than the previous one. Phase 1 establishes the vaccine’s safety in a small group of healthy individuals, with the goal of ruling out debilitating side effects. Phases 2 and 3 test efficacy, and in an outbreak like the present one they are conducted in places where the disease is prevalent. In parallel with these later phases, production capacity for the candidate vaccine is gradually built up, so that factories are capable of producing it on a large scale if and when regulatory agencies judge that it should be licensed.\\nIn an article published in The New England Journal of Medicine on 30 March, representatives of the Oslo-based not-for-profit Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi), which is helping to finance and coordinate Covid-19 vaccine development, laid out an accelerated version of this process that they believe is more suited to a pandemic. This “pandemic paradigm” implements certain steps in parallel, such as animal and phase-1 clinical testing. It also involves scaling up production capacity before sufficient safety and efficacy data are available – a financially risky step, given that that may never materialise, and one that requires governments and not-for-profit organisations such as Cepi to share that extra financial risk with pharmaceutical companies if they want them to engage. Mass production is critical in a pandemic, when hundreds of millions if not billions of doses are needed – and many countries are now scrambling to build new vaccine production facilities.\\n“People now appreciate that the lengthy process of conventional licensing of vaccines is not going to be helpful in the context of an epidemic,” says Beate Kampmann, who heads the vaccine centre at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.\\nBringing a new vaccine to the clinic has taken 10 to 20 years in the past\\nPrudently, Cepi did not attach a timeline to its accelerated paradigm, but the 12- to 18-month estimate already takes it into account. Bringing a new vaccine to the clinic has taken 10 to 20 years in the past. Nevertheless, the accelerated paradigm is being implemented now. A Boston-based biotech firm, Moderna, saw its experimental Covid-19 vaccine enter human trials on 16 March, just 10 weeks after the first genetic sequences of Sars-CoV-2 – the virus that causes the disease – were released. Others will follow soon.\\n“We’re getting to candidates much more quickly,” says Kampmann, who puts this progress down to advances made in the fight against Ebola. “The step-up in technology that we have seen in the last five years has really made a difference.”\\nThere are many hurdles ahead, though. Most of the 70-odd Covid-19 vaccine candidates being developed and tested will not make it to the licensing stage, and those that have been fastest out of the blocks may still encounter problems later on. Moderna’s innovative technology allowed it to generate a candidate quickly, but no vaccine using this platform has been licensed to date.\\nScientists at the Pasteur Institute in Paris are working on a vaccine that piggybacks on a licensed measles vaccine, speeding up the testing, licensing and production process. Photograph: François Mori/AP\\nAt the Pasteur Institute in Paris, on the other hand, a Covid-19 vaccine candidate is still in pre-clinical development, but because it piggybacks on established technology – a licensed measles vaccine – the testing and licensing processes will go faster. And this kind of vaccine can already be produced in large quantities.\\nWhile there can be no shortcuts to establishing safety and efficacy, proposals have been put forward for how these experimental vaccines might be tested more rapidly without sacrificing scientific rigour. In February, for example, the WHO published a draft protocol for phase 2 and 3 trials that would test a number of candidates simultaneously, in multi-country trials according to standardised criteria.\\nAnother proposal is to conduct controlled human challenge trials, in which healthy volunteers are given a candidate vaccine and then infected with Sars-CoV-2. These are ethically questionable, especially before scientists understand why young and otherwise healthy people are ending up on ventilators. A similar approach, being implemented by the London-based clinical research group Hvivo, invites volunteers to be infected with a milder coronavirus – but how applicable its findings will be to Sars-CoV-2 is not clear.\\nIf our own body can’t prevent us from getting it again, that would be one pretty damning signal\\nMarian Wentworth, health CEO\\nThere are still many unknowns with respect to Covid-19, including for how long any vaccine will provide protection. A strong indication of this will be whether people who have recovered from the disease can catch it again. There have been anecdotal reports of re-infection, but the phenomenon is not well understood. “If our own body can’t prevent us from getting it again, that would be one pretty damning signal,” says Wentworth.\\nOnce a vaccine is licensed, there will still be political obstacles to getting it to where it’s needed, because each country or public health jurisdiction has to make its own decision to roll it out. There will also be issues of prioritisation – who should get it first, if supplies are limited – which authorities are discussing now.\\nA vaccine that is approved a year from now may arrive after the end of the current pandemic, but if so it won’t be wasted – first because Covid-19 may recur seasonally, and second because the vaccine could itself be repurposed in the event of an outbreak of a different coronavirus. That will be no consolation to victims of this pandemic, or their relatives, but it does mean that humanity will be better protected in future. As Wentworth says: “That learning, we won’t unlearn.”\\nDue to the unprecedented and ongoing nature of the coronavirus outbreak, this article is being regularly updated to ensure that it reflects the current situation as best as possible.

       "  'Vaccine passports, which would allow people with immunity to Covid to prove they were at low risk of spreading the disease, are being investigated by companies and countries around the world. But the proposals have also raised fears among critics that they could underpin an oppressive digital ID system, and put sensitive medical records in the hands of authorities and employers.\\nDespite the name, a vaccine passport is not a piece of paper; instead, in the most developed versions of the idea, it is an app or similar system that can prove the bearer has been vaccinated, tested positive for Covid antibodies, or recently received a negative test. There would be no need to build and operate a privacy violating centralised database.\\nThe pressures on such a system are similar to those faced by the NHS in building its contact-tracing app. A centralised system, which simply keeps a database of people who have been vaccinated and allows them to grant access to others, may be easiest to build, but poses unacceptable privacy burdens. Instead, one proposed system, developed by two British firms, Mvine and iProov, would be secured with a biometric identifier, preventing the records from being accessed without the bearer’s consent.\\n“This kind of technology enables the medical professional administering the vaccination to create the online certificate using a phone or tablet, and then to ask the user to have a selfie added to their electronic certificate,” says Andrew Bud, the founder and chief executive of iProov. “The certificate does not need to include the name, address, NHS number or any other identifying information about the person – it is completely anonymous.”\\nBud envisions such passports being used in a variety of situations. “Travel is the obvious example,” he says. “Paper vaccination certificates have been a feature of travel to some countries for many years. This kind of digital vaccination certificate may well be needed for travel abroad in future. Aside from travel, employers may decide that access to offices is only safe if an employee or a visitor has one. Universities might make the same choice.”\\nMvine and iProov are moving into the testing phase of their app, which received £75,000 startup funding from the UK government last year. But the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) says it has no plans to introduce a vaccine passport nationwide. A spokesperson says: “At this stage of the vaccination programme, it is not clear whether vaccines will prevent transmission. As large numbers of people from at-risk groups are vaccinated, we will be able to gather the evidence to prove the impact on infection rates, hospitalisation and reduced deaths.

At $113m it was the most expensive Indian home ever sold when they bought it in 2015.\\nPoonawalla, who was educated at £30,000-a-year St Edmund’s School in Canterbury and the University of Westminster, this week signed a deal to rent a Mayfair mansion for a record £50,000 a week.\\nThe property, which at 2,3oo sq metres (25,000 sq ft) is 24 times the size of the average English home, comes with an adjoining guest house and backs on to one of Mayfair’s “secret gardens”. He is renting it from Polish billionaire Dominika Kulczyk, who bought it for £57m last year.\\nPoonawalla, who is married with two children, travels by helicopter and private jet.

But, it then adds, “the flamboyance is cultivated” and that he is actually “a serious young man who has been trained by a difficult boss – his father Cyrus Poonawala”.\\nProducing vaccines was not Poonawalla’s idea. His father, Cyrus, founded SII in 1966 as a sideline to his 81-hectare (200-acre) thoroughbred racehorse stables Poonawalla Stud. (Serum from purified horse blood was used in the production of early vaccines for diphtheria, tetanus, and scarlet fever.)\\nBut it was Poonawalla who convinced his father to “go big” on vaccines after he watched a Bill Gates talk in 2015, in which the billionaire Microsoft co-founder-turned philanthropist warned that the world was not prepared for a new viral pandemic.\\n“I wanted to be prepared for a pandemic-level event ever since I heard Bill Gates in a Ted talk where he clearly said that we should be more worried and prepared for such situations,” Poonawalla told the Hindustan Times.\\nHe doubled the firm’s production facilities and began producing more vaccines for developing countries on behalf of the World Health Organization and Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (Gavi), the vaccine charity supported by Gates and of which Poonawalla is a board member.\\nThe “vaccine prince” title stuck when Poonawalla was appointed chief executive of SII in 2011, replacing his “vaccine king” father, who is now chairman of wider Poonawalla Group, which includes SII.\\nThe Serum Institute of India campus in Pune, where it makes Covid-19 vaccine.

Packed in dry ice was a vial containing the components needed to create the Oxford vaccine, cell substrate in which to grow it and detailed instructions.

We never imagined the whole world being so dependent on us, but nobody else has our capacity to scale up,” he said. The decision to invest, he added, was easy because the firm is a private business “and not accountable to investors and bankers and shareholders”.\\nInstead, he says, “it was just a quick five-minute chat between myself and my father.” It was also, he admits, “a huge gamble – huge, huge, huge.

This $400m facility, which is due to open in 2024, is designed to produce 1bn vaccine doses a year.

Before this year, there had never been a vaccine for a coronavirus.\\nThe development came as a relief to the UK government, which has invested heavily and ordered 100m doses – enough for the whole adult population\\nMatt Hancock, the health secretary, said that subject to regulatory approval, the bulk of the UK rollout could come in the new year, while the prime minister said a “favourable wind” could allow the majority of people most in need of a vaccination to receive one by Easter. “I don’t want to give any more hostages to fortune than that, but that’s the best information we have,” Johnson told a Downing Street press conference.\\nIt was also hailed as exciting news for the rest of the world, especially low-income countries. The vaccine is low-cost, at £3 a dose compared with more than £20 for the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, which also released results this month.\\nThe latest vaccine does not need to be shipped and stored in ultra-cold freezers, solving a huge logistical problem posed by the others, and there is good data that it will work as well in elderly people as in younger people.\\n“The announcement today takes us another step closer to the time when we can use vaccines to bring an end to the devastation caused by [Covid-19],” Prof Sarah Gilbert from the University of Oxford, who has led the research, told the Guardian. “We will continue to work to provide the detailed information to regulators. It has been a privilege to be part of this multinational effort, which will reap benefits for the whole world.”\\nQuick Guide\\nWhen will I get offered the vaccine in the UK?\\nShow\\nThe long-anticipated efficacy results revealed on Monday delivered a major surprise. Overall efficacy from trials in the UK and Brazil was 70%, but the vaccine worked better in people given a lower first dose. Those who got a half dose, followed four weeks later by a full dose, enjoyed 90% protection, while efficacy among those who had two full doses was 62%.\\nWhile AstraZeneca said it would submit its data to the UK regulator immediately. New trials will have to be run in the United States, where the half-dose regime was not being tested, pushing back any possibility of the vaccine being available there before Christmas.\\nThe scientists said they could not fully explain why a lower first dose appeared to give better protection. “We think that by giving a smaller first dose that we’re priming the immune system differently – we’re setting it up better to respond,” said Prof Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group and chief investigator of the trial. “And what we don’t know at this moment is whether that difference is in the quality or the quantity of immune response.”\\nGilbert said people should not assume that the other two vaccines, which achieved 95% efficacy in trials and were both made using a different, novel mRNA technology that uses genetic code instead of virus, were better. The trials had not been set up to measure the same things.\\n“We need to bear in mind these are early data,” she said. “We have additional trials running. Those numbers may be a little bit different in the ultimate analysis. You can’t directly compare the readout from different clinical trials. If you don’t have the same criteria for enrolling people or endpoint cases, you can’t compare.”\\nExperts were enthusiastic about the vaccine, which has long been one of the biggest hopes for taming the pandemic worldwide. Oxford/AstraZeneca have joined Covax, the World Health Organization-led programme to distribute vaccines to all countries, and done deals with manufacturers in other countries. The Serum Institute of India is to make 1bn doses.\\n“If there is anyone out there who still doubts that a Covid-19 vaccine can help us out of this pandemic, the announcement today from Oxford University/AstraZeneca should surely dispel that doubt,” said Eleanor Riley, a professor of immunology and infectious disease at the University of Edinburgh. “This is excellent news – another vaccine that can prevent symptomatic infections and, even better is cheap to produce and easy to distribute.”\\nDr Richard Hatchett, the chief executive of the Coalition for Vaccine Preparedness (CEPI) which is involved in Covax, said they believed the Oxford vaccine “has the potential to significantly alter the course of the global pandemic. The data released today suggest the vaccine is safe and comparable in its efficacy to other licensed vaccines – including influenza – that are widely used to protect people around the world today.”\\nOxford/AstraZeneca say they believed their vaccine may help stop transmission, potentially preventing the spread of the coronavirus, as well as protecting people from becoming ill. Unlike other vaccines, they have collected weekly swabs sent from UK volunteers given home test kits. The data, which has not yet been published, suggests a reduction in asymptomatic infection among people who were vaccinated.\\nHancock said that if the data was approved by the regulator, the vaccine would be available for most people next year. “This is really encouraging news on the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, that obviously we’ve been backing since the start,” he told Sky News. “And I’m really very pleased, really welcome these figures, this data, that show that the vaccine in the right dosage can be up to 90% effective.\\n“Of course, it’s vital that the independent regulator, the MHRA [Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency], will need to look at the data, will need to check to make sure that it’s effective and safe of course. But we’ve got 100m doses on order and should all that go well, the bulk of the rollout will be in the new year.”\\nDr Charlie Weller, the head of vaccines at Wellcome, said every effective vaccine would be needed. “To have interim results from three vaccine teams within a year is incredible, and testament to a truly extraordinary global scientific effort. We need a range of vaccines, that can protect people of different ages and backgrounds wherever they live, and to be able to manufacture enough doses for the world.\\n“To meet the aim of vaccinating high-risk populations around the world over the next year we need at least 2bn vaccine doses.”',\n",
       "  \"I\\nmarked a grim anniversary in an unexpected manner last week. On 18 January last year, I wrote my first story about a mysterious disease that had struck Wuhan, in China, and which was now spreading around the world. More than two million individuals have since died of Covid-19, almost 100,000 of them in the UK.\\nRemarkably, 12 months to the day that the Observer published my story, I was given my first dose of Covid-19 vaccine, allowing me to follow nearly six million other newly immunised UK residents who are set to gain protection against a disease that has brought the planet to a standstill. It was a rare, comforting experience after a year of unremitting sadness and gloom.\\nNot that the vaccine frees me up to have wild times. I am 70 after all. More to the point I have another two weeks until my first jab fully arms my immune system, before waiting for a second dose to seal the deal. And, even then, my continued risk of transmitting the virus – although unaffected by symptoms – means, quite rightly, that I am still subject to rules governing lockdown, mask-wearing and social distancing.\\nOn the other hand, the vaccine has made me feel more secure. And by protecting people over the age of 70 – who account for vast numbers of Covid deaths in the UK – this should free up hospital beds and get our health service back on its feet. Normality might then return, albeit slowly.\\nCovid vaccines are a triumph of modern medical science, and the one beacon of hope we have in these dark days. But how, exactly, do they work?\\nMy vaccine, made by Pfizer-BioNTech, contains genetic material that is known as messenger RNA or simply mRNA. These pieces are synthetic copies of mRNA found in Covid-19 viruses and are put in a protective chemical coat called a lipid. Injected into the muscle of my left arm, these pieces of mRNA were then swept up by tiny entities in my body called antigen-presenting cells.\\nNHS staff and key workers queue for the coronavirus vaccine in Glasgow. Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images\\nThe virus’s mRNA will then have been incorporated into these presenting cells’ protein-making machinery causing them to make pieces of virus. The cells, bearing viral protein, would then have been carried to my lymph glands in my armpits where my immune system should now be swinging into action. “The cells carrying viral protein tell your immune system there is something foreign invading your body and it is time it did something about it,” Professor Adam Finn, of Bristol University, told me. “This is done by switching on entities called killer T-cells. Only a small number among millions are chosen, however: the ones that are perfectly suited to tackle cells carrying the offending pieces of foreign viral protein that is presented to them. These few cells have been circulating in your body just waiting to be called into action. They are instructed to start dividing and to grow until millions of copies are made in a few days.”\\nThis cellular armada of tiny killer T-cells will then sweep through my body to hunt out cells carrying offending virus particles, destroying them by issuing chemical instructions telling them to self-destruct. At the same time, another set of immune cells, known as B-cells, will start manufacturing antibodies specifically designed to latch on to pieces of viral protein and so block their action.\\n“This whole process takes two or three weeks to get under way,” added Finn. “If it were a real viral attack you might not have enough time to mount a defence and you could be swamped by invading viruses.”\\nWorld's poor need action, not Covid 'vaccine nationalism', say experts\\nRead more\\nHowever, by mimicking the Covid-19 virus, the vaccine is now preparing my immune system for an impending attack should I become infected one day.\\nOther vaccines, such as the Oxford-AstraZeneca version, operate in slightly different ways but are also designed to achieve the same goal – to stop Covid from gaining a beachhead in a person’s tissue before an all-out invasion. Dozens of other vaccines designed to trigger our antibody and killer T-cells are now in development. As government chief scientist Patrick Vallance put it last week: “We now have more vaccines than we could ever have dreamt of a year ago.”\\nBut one question still concerns me about my Pfizer vaccine: just how well will I be protected against Covid-19? I ask because some reports say my first jab should give me at least 90% protection against serious illness; others say only 52%. Which is right? Vaccine efficacy is a critically important issue. It will determine how quickly and efficiently we get out of national lockdown and return to normality. The efficacy of a vaccine is calculated by comparing two groups of people: those who get the vaccine and those who get a placebo.\\nInfection rates for the two groups are measured daily. At first, there are no differences in case numbers because the vaccine needs time to take effect. This picture changes quickly, however. Slowly, infection rates decline in the first group as the vaccine takes effect, until, after three weeks, there are 90% fewer cases in the vaccinated group compared with the placebo group – hence the UK Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunity’s statement that “vaccine efficacy from the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is around 90%.”\\nPfizer takes a more cautious approach in calculating first-dose efficacy than does the UK Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunity. Photograph: Dado Ruvić/Reuters\\nBy contrast, Pfizer takes the distinctly cautious approach of calculating efficacy from the day the first dose is given – when the vaccine has had no chance to provide protection and efficacy is zero. This process produces an average figure for vaccine efficacy of 52%.\\nThe disadvantage of this approach is stressed by many scientists including UK vaccine expert Peter English. “If you include people who have not had time to respond to the vaccine then its efficacy obviously appears to be much lower. However, it is more appropriate to exclude them, as you wouldn’t have expected the vaccine to have worked yet.”\\nWhy Pfizer takes this approach is a matter of some conjecture but the message is clear as far as I am concerned. I will have 90% protection against Covid-19 in another couple of weeks. So am I concerned that I will have to wait a couple of months more to get my second dose? No, I’m not. My existing protection should last well beyond that time.\\nThe pandemic one year on: 100,000 dead in the UK from coronavirus\\nRead more\\nNot everything will be plain sailing, of course. New variants of the Covid-19 virus are appearing. At present, there is no evidence that existing vaccines will fail to neutralise the variants observed so far in the UK. But scientists are concerned that a new strain could evolve in future and evade current immunisations.\\nUK bosses set up IT systems to track Covid vaccine status of staff\\nRead more\\n“It is a genuine concern,” said Finn. “A new variant could start to avoid antibodies triggered by your vaccine. However, you will still have T-cells to mount a defence, and that means that the immunity provided by the vaccine you got last week is very unlikely to become completely useless should such a variant appear.”\\nIt is not a blanket reassurance. But given what we have all endured over the past year, I am going to accept, with considerable gratitude, what Covid vaccines will do for my health, and for the wellbeing of others.\\nThis article was amended on 24 January 2021 to clarify that the synthetic mRNA is not incorporated into the genetic material of the body’s antigen-presenting cells as an earlier version stated.

       "  \"Most poor countries will not achieve mass Covid-19 immunisation until at least 2024 and some may never get there, according to a new forecast, which maps a starkly divided world over the next few years in which a handful of developed countries are fully vaccinated while others race to catch up.\\nCountries such as the UK, US, Israel and those in the EU will probably achieve “widespread vaccination coverage” – meaning priority and vulnerable groups, and almost all of the rest of the population – by late 2021, according to analysis from the Economist Intelligence Unit. They will be followed by a slew of other developed countries by the middle of 2022 and then most middle-income countries by the end of that year.\\nUK must cancel poor countries' debt or face Covid-19 'financial tsunami'\\nRead more\\nBut 84 countries that make up the world’s poorest will not receive enough doses to sufficiently immunise their populations for at least a further year, a global faultline that will run through the first half of this decade, said Agathe Demarais, the unit’s global forecasting director and author of the report.\\n“It’s going to define the global economy, the global political landscape, travel, pretty much everything,” she said.\\nAnnouncements beginning last December that successive vaccine candidates were safe and highly effective provided a light at the end of the tunnel, but the report released on Wednesday underscored that, in most countries, the end of the outbreak is still a year away, at least.\\nThe key reason is the myriad hurdles in delivering doses into arms: securing vaccine ingredients, production constraints, delays in delivery, poor medical infrastructure in some countries and lack of trained health workers to administer injections, among others.\\nIn countries such as India and China, with vast populations scattered across large landmasses, “reaching everyone in the most remote regions is going to be quite an endeavour”, Demarais said.\\nThe forecast was put together using a model that assessed more than 200 countries based on factors including existing supply deals, production capacity, vaccine deliveries so far, infrastructure to administer doses and vaccine hesitancy rates.\\nHigh scepticism towards vaccines in Japan was a factor in why it was unlikely to achieve full immunisation this year, Demarais said.\\nThe report was sceptical of forecasts by Covax, a global vaccine-sharing alliance, that it would supply enough doses this year to cover 27% of populations in member countries including more than 92 lower-income ones. The scheme aims to being administering vaccines next month and will announce each country’s first allocations this week.\\nGermany challenges AstraZeneca Covid vaccine efficacy reports\\nRead more\\n“There’s a lot of political hope that the targets will be hit … but we can see there are already delays for production and delivery in richer countries, so we can expect some delay in poor countries,” Demarais said.\\nA study released on Monday found that unequal distribution of vaccines could sap more than $9tn from global GDP this year by depressing consumer demand in unvaccinated countries where normal life had yet to resume.\\nOngoing lockdowns and widespread sickness would also interrupt global supply chains, with wealthier, vaccinated countries bearing about half the economic cost, the report from the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) said. “[Sharing vaccines equitably] is not charity, it is economic common sense,” said the ICC’s secretary-general John Denton.\\nThe WHO director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, last week said the world was on the edge of a “catastrophic moral failure” in the unequal distribution of vaccines so far, with more than 40m doses given in about 50 countries, most of them wealthy or upper-middle income.\\nMedical rights groups have called for patents on Covid-19 vaccines and treatments to be shared so that qualified manufacturers can also begin producing them and ease global shortages. Demarais said that, even if pharmaceutical companies shared their technology, patents and knowhow, there would still be challenges in finding workers trained to produce vaccines.\\n“There are a number of factories now that are running out of labour supply, experienced workers who can manufacture the vaccines to sufficient quality,” she said.\",\n",
       "  \"A vaccine against Covid-19 may not work well in older people who are most at risk of becoming seriously ill and dying from the disease, say scientists, which may mean immunising others around them, such as children.\\nProf Peter Openshaw, from Imperial, one of the members of the UK’s Sage scientific advisory sub-group Nervtag, told the House of Lords science and technology committee it was this week considering a paper on targeting different groups in the population with vaccines.\\n“Sometimes it is possible to protect a vulnerable group by targeting another group and this, for example, is being done with influenza,” he said. “In the past few years, the UK has been at the forefront of rolling out the live attenuated vaccine for children.”\\nGiving the nasal spray flu vaccine to children who do not often get severe flu protects their grandparents, he said. Immunising health and care workers – who are likely to be the first to get the vaccine – would also help protect older people who have the most contact with them.\\nArne Akbar, professor of immunology at UCL and president of the British Society of Immunology, said scientists needed to work out what goes wrong with the immune system as people get older.\\n“One thing that’s apparent, even in healthy older people, is that there’s more inflammation all around the body. We need to understand where that inflammation is coming from,” he said. “And this baseline inflammation in older people is linked to frailty and many negative outcomes as we get older. And this seems to be exacerbated when you get a severe infection like Covid-19.\\n“But what is the source of the inflammation in the first place? That’s something that we really need to get to grips with.”\\nAkbar said something else might be needed alongside the vaccine for older people, such as the steroid drug dexamethasone, which can block the inflammation caused by the virus and has been shown to save lives in Covid-19.\\n“So for older people, you might have something like an anti-inflammatory drug, like maybe dexamethasone, together with vaccine responses to give you the maximum benefit.\\n“Just the vaccine alone will help the younger people and that will be good, because then if the younger people are not infected they won’t spread it to the older people. But it won’t directly help the older group very much, and they’re the people that are having the most severe disease right now.”\\nThe committee took evidence as Oxford University announced successful trials of two doses of its candidate vaccine in pigs, which respond in a similar way to humans. The Pirbright Institute, working with the vaccine scientists, established that two doses resulted in a significantly increased antibody response over one dose.\\n“It is not yet known what level of immune response will be required to protect humans against Sars-CoV-2. Vaccine efficacy trials are under way in humans, and if the efficacy result is lower than hoped for after a single dose, it is important to know if giving two doses could result in a greater immune response, which could then be more protective,” said a statement.\\nSarah Gilbert, professor of vaccinology at Oxford University, who is heading its Covid-19 vaccine research, told the Lords committee that none of the 140 vaccines in development was likely to be perfect, but said a useful vaccine did not have to be 100% effective.\\n“Even with 50% accuracy, we could actually go a long way to protecting the population. So we’re optimistic that we will have something, and, if necessary, we can combine the vaccines to get something that works even better,” she said.\\nAs the numbers of people infected with coronavirus fall in England and the rest of the UK, it becomes more difficult to trial vaccines there, so she and colleagues have embarked on a trial in Brazil, where the numbers are high, and are about to start in South Africa as well. Astra Zeneca, to whom the vaccine is licensed, is setting up a trial of 30,000 people in the US, she said.\\nShare your story\\nShare your stories\\nIf you have been affected or have any information, we'd like to hear from you.

       "  'In December 2006, the Indonesian authorities refused to hand over samples of the bird flu virus without guarantees that it would benefit from any vaccine produced from them. Amid the swine flu outbreak in 2009, the Australian government ordered a vaccine manufacturer to meet its demand before fulfilling orders overseas. That November, after several rich nations had secured vaccines, officials from the World Health Organization aired concerns that disaster could lie ahead.\\n“Things would be much worse if the pandemic had been more severe, and it would be more difficult to create some fairness in the distribution of vaccine,” said Marie-Paule Kieny, the then head of the WHO’s initiative for vaccine research. “Governments might be less inclined to share the vaccine that they have.”\\nWith vaccines seen as one of the few real routes out of the coronavirus crisis, fears of “vaccine nationalism” are already increasing. Each step of creating, testing and mass-producing a vaccine is an epic challenge – but the political and ethical decisions around its subsequent distribution pose another. Governments, including in the UK, are being questioned about how they will get to the front of the queue. How will any eventual vaccine be shared out? Who decides? Will supplies go to the highest bidder? Are rich nations buying up potential vaccines already? And what will stop governments from simply seizing vaccines made in their country?\\nAccording to experts and industry, it will take at least a year to vaccinate the world from the moment vaccines become available. That’s a 12-month queue, if things go well – after a vaccine is found. “The reality is that there is no process established for this,” says Steven Jones, a Canadian member of a team that created a successful Ebola vaccine.\\nThe potential problems have been spotted. On Friday, a parade of world leaders, charity bosses and industry chiefs, including French president Emmanuel Macron, German chancellor Angela Merkel and philanthropist Melinda Gates, united to back a WHO initiative to ensure any treatments and vaccines are shared equitably around the world. Dominic Raab also supported it. Yet just as notable were the nations not in attendance – the US, China, Russia and India.\\n0\\nWorld leaders agree to cooperate on coronavirus vaccine, but US does not take part – video\\nA delicate system of international cooperation is having to be pursued in the middle of a crisis. “We are talking about billions of doses being available to all,” says Charlie Weller, the Wellcome Trust’s head of vaccines. “We haven’t got a roadmap for how to do that. Many of these discussions are being worked out now.”\\nMarie-Paule Kieny, a former head of the World Health Organization’s vaccine research initiative, warned that governments may not be inclined to share a vaccine discovered in their country. Photograph: Denis Balibouse/Reuters\\nThere are organisations designed to help the fair distribution of a vaccine – most notably Gavi, which aims to increase access to poor countries, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation, which the UK helps to fund. However, some are blunt about the hopes of centrally-managed global cooperation. “Can you imagine the WHO telling Donald Trump that he can only have one tenth of the vaccine that he wants,” says David Salisbury, the former director of immunisation at the Department of Health. “Surely, he’s going to look to see who can make a vaccine in the quantities needed in America, and he’s not going to let the vaccine out. That will happen.”\\nJones is also pessimistic. “The WHO can try to take a leadership role but they are in a difficult situation. They can try to apply moral and ethical guidelines.”\\nUK ministers, too, have already been under pressure to guarantee that Britain will benefit first from vaccines discovered here. Matt Hancock has said he is “ensuring the UK is both contributing to and benefiting from efforts around the globe”.\\nIt is inevitable that some nations will try to use “advance purchase agreements” to secure supplies, paying potential vaccine producers on the off-chance that their product works. Such agreements provide funds for research, but there is no system for policing their impact on fair distribution.\\nUnfortunately, a vaccine queue is inevitable. Making billions of doses, rather than millions, adds another order of difficulty. Hence, Weller told a briefing last week: “For at least a year after the Covid-19 vaccine becomes available, it is very likely that there’ll be insufficient supply to meet the global demand of billions of doses.”\\nThomas Breuer, chief medical officer of GSK Vaccines, paints an even starker picture. His company is working with fellow pharmaceutical giant Sanofi to develop a production process that could deliver big quantities. “Let’s say the GSK-Sanofi approach succeeds, that alone will not be enough to supply 20% of the world’s population within one year,” he says. “Several of the large-scale solutions have to come into play if we want to cater for the world’s population over a period of one to two years. One company alone is not enough.”\\nThe hunt for a coronavirus vaccine – a perilous and uncertain path\\nRead more\\nThere is also concern from industry about being thrust into the middle of an impossible political tug of war. “They are going to have huge numbers of customers, a lot of whom are going to be waving dollar bills, euros and pounds,” says Salisbury. Hence, many are praying for an international agreement. “Now is the time to be having the government conversation about those allocation principles,” says Richard Torbett, chief executive of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry. “Let’s not wait until we’ve got something to fight over.” He adds that it simply will not be left to manufacturers to decide who gets what. “They will start from the point of saying, we want to maximise global access.”\\nThe threat of export bans on vaccines is clearly a concern. “It would really be a mistake for global leaders to be tempted into that sort of behaviour,” says Torbett. He hopes that, in the end, the need for multiple vaccines from many different global sources could encourage international cooperation: “Every country will want to have fair allocation.”\\nWhile some leaders may be tempted to go it alone, Weller says such actions could ultimately come back to haunt them: “As long as Covid is out of control somewhere, it threatens everyone, everywhere. That’s what it comes down to.”',\n",
       "  'The US was in a hurry to vaccinate on Wednesday as Joe Biden announced the day before that all US adults would be eligible to receive the Covid-19 vaccine by 19 April, even as he warned that the nation was still in a “life-and-death race” against the virus.\\nHalf of all US adults are expected to have had at least one shot of the available vaccines by the start of next week and 108 million have been vaccinated so far in the US, covering more than 40% of the eligible population aged 16 and older – or almost a third of the total population of the US.\\nBut many states are still seeing coronavirus on the rise. Michigan, for example, is seeing rates of increase not experienced since the late autumn surge in November, with three quarters of new cases believed to be the more contagious UK variant of Covid-19.\\nPairing optimism with caution at the White House on Tuesday, the president touted the administration’s success in accelerating the pace of the vaccination effort, including the milestone of administering a record 4m doses in a single day. But that progress, he said, is threatened by the rise in coronavirus cases in many states across the US as dangerous variants spread and some officials loosen public health restrictions.\\n“We aren’t at the finish line. We still have a lot of work to do,” Biden said in remarks at the White House on Tuesday. “We’re still in a life-and-death race against this virus.”\\nIn his remarks, Biden expressed confidence that every American over the age of 18 would be eligible to get in the “virtual line” to be vaccinated soon.\\nThe White House coronavirus expert team, led by Dr Anthony Fauci, will deliver its latest briefing to the public on Wednesday morning.\\nFauci warned against young people in particular behaving as though the pandemic were over.\\n“More and more young people are getting into serious trouble,” he said, with young adults susceptible to “serious disease requiring hospitalizations and sometimes even resulting in tragic deaths”.\\nYoung people are thought to be driving rising numbers in Michigan, for example, where the confirmed total of cases has reached 700,000 and is rising by more than 5,600 a day, the highest rate since December.\\nMeanwhile, a number of US states have already said they will meet the accelerated timeline for vaccine eligibility, which is roughly two weeks earlier than the initial 1 May goal. Meanwhile, states such as New Jersey and Oregon announced this week that all Americans over 16 would be eligible to sign up for a vaccine on 19 April.\\nBiden said the new deadline would eliminate uncertainty about eligibility, which varies by state. “No more confusing rules, no more confusing restrictions,” he said.\\nThe president delivered his remarks after visiting a Covid-19 vaccination site in Alexandria, Virginia, where he thanked healthcare workers for administering the shots and urged those getting them to encourage their friends and family to do the same.\\n“When you go home, get all your friends, tell them, ‘Get a shot when they can,’” he said. “That’s how we’re going to beat this.”\\nThe administration informed governors during a weekly conference call that more than 28m doses of the coronavirus vaccine will be delivered to states this week, the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, said at her daily briefing. That allocation brings the cumulative total over the past three weeks to 90m doses, she said.\\nPsaki also said that the administration does not support the creation of a vaccine passport or a federal vaccine database.\\n“The government is not now, nor will we be supporting a system that requires Americans to carry a credential,” she said. “There will be no federal vaccinations database and no federal mandate requiring everyone to obtain a single vaccination credential.”\\nBiden also announced that the US had delivered 150m doses of the coronavirus vaccine since the start of his presidency, putting him on track to “beat” his goal of administering 200m shots by his 100th day in office. Biden initially set a goal of achieving 100m shots in his first 100 days, which many experts worried was not ambitious enough. But the administration surpassed that target in March and doubled the number.\\nBut he said it was imperative to continue to follow public safety measures like mask wearing and social distancing.\\nSketching a tantalizing vision of a Fourth of July barbecue with friends and family, Biden promised: “Better times are ahead.”\\n“I want to have an Independence Day – an independence from the Covid,” he said, adding that the challenge remained: “How much death, disease and misery are we going to see between now and then.”',\n",
       "  'A successful vaccine for Covid-19 will not conquer the spread of the virus alone, with restrictions on daily life likely to continue for some time, a team of experts have said.\\nHundreds of teams of researchers around the world are working to produce a vaccine against the coronavirus, with 11 currently in phase three human trials. The UK government has reserved access to six potential vaccines and has raised hopes that a vaccine could be on the cards by spring next year.\\nCovid vaccine tracker: when will a coronavirus vaccine be ready?\\nRead more\\nA report from a multidisciplinary group convened by the Royal Society, called Delve (Data Evaluation and Learning for Viral Epidemics), says there are serious challenges to producing a vaccine, including hurdles in manufacturing and storage, questions around how well vaccines will work, and problems with public trust.\\nProf Nilay Shah, the head of the department of chemical engineering at Imperial College London, and an author of the report, said that while there would be vaccines available in March – not least because manufacturing is beginning before the results of trials are known– the question was whether they will have been shown to be effective and passed regulatory processes.\\n“Even if we get through that and the material is available and vaccination does start in the spring, it will take a long time to work through the different priority groups initially and then the wider population later on,” he said, adding that it may take up to a year.\\nProf Charles Bangham, the chair of immunology at Imperial College London and a co-author of the report, said: “Even if it is effective, it is very unlikely that we will be able to get back completely to normal. There is going to be a sliding scale even after the introduction of a vaccine that we know to be effective. We will have to gradually relax some of the other interventions.”\\nBangham said few vaccines completely block an infection, but they can reduce both the severity of disease and the chance of passing it on. However, in the case of vaccines in development against Covid, myriad questions remain.\\nConcerns have already been raised that vaccines against Covid may be less effective in older adults than in other groups – a potential issue if supplies are limited and vaccinations have to be prioritised to those most at risk from becoming infected.\\nThe team says a policy of vaccinating widely in an attempt to produce herd immunity could also run into potential difficulties, particularly if the vaccine has limited effectiveness. And for any mass vaccination programme, there are manufacturing and supply hurdles to overcome.\\n“We need to make sure that [we are going to have] all the ingredients for these tens of millions of doses in the UK, and several billions globally,” said Shah, noting that these range from chemicals to glass vials, while some may need to be kept at extremely low temperatures.\\nA vaccination programme would need to carried out at about 10 times the pace of seasonal flu vaccinations, said Shah. “That would need many thousands of individual healthcare workers, retrained people, dedicated solely to delivering vaccinations,” he said.\\nPublic trust in a vaccine may also present a hurdle. Dr Zania Stamataki, a researcher in viral immunology at the University of Birmingham, said: “By the time the first vaccines are released, we need to do our best to dispel any myths surrounding vaccination and reassure individuals and families that they are safe, tested properly and that no corners have been cut in their preparation at all regarding safety.”\\nIn response to the DELVE report, the department of health and social care said: “This study fails to reflect the enormous amount of planning and preparation that has taken place across Government to quickly rollout a safe and effective Covid-19 vaccine. Our plans include significantly expanding the trained workforce who can administer COVID-19 and flu vaccines, making it faster and easier for patients to access the vaccines they need.”\\n“We are also confident we have adequate provision or transport, PPE and logistical expertise to deploy a Covid-19 vaccine across the country as quickly as possible.”',\n",

But that is an important discussion on the public health and safety that needs to be had with states and territories, who are responsible for public health.”\\nThe comments leave open the possibility states could mandate the vaccine, but Morrison dismissed this as “over-interpretation”.\\nOn Thursday the secretary of the health department, Brendan Murphy, recommitted that the vaccine will be free with “no barrier whatsoever” such as out-of-pocket costs.\\nOn 23 December, the Labor leader Anthony Albanese called for an accelerated rollout of Covid-19 vaccines after they receive approval by the Therapeutic Goods Administration, a call later echoed across the political spectrum and by independent experts who want faster vaccination to respond to the UK super-strain.\\nAt the time, Hunt characterised Albanese’s call as irresponsible, but has since announced two revisions in the vaccine rollout timetable.\\nAsked about repeated assurances Australia was at the front of the queue for vaccines, Morrison explained it had taken a “cautious” approach to preserve public confidence in the vaccines.\\nHunt argued the rollout is in line with other countries that have opted against emergency approvals due to lower coronavirus case numbers, such as New Zealand, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan.\\n“Safety leads to confidence, and confidence leads to higher vaccine take-up,” he said.\\nAhead of a national cabinet meeting on Friday, the Victorian premier Daniel Andrews has indicated Australia is likely to adopt pre-flight testing and more constraints on international flight crews to prevent the UK super-strain spreading in Australia.\\nAndrews told reporters in Melbourne that he supports both pre-flight testing of passengers and for crew to be treated “like returned travellers”, meaning they would remain in quarantine at least until they had received a negative coronavirus test and possibly for a full 14 days.\\nVictoria will also push for daily testing of hotel workers – a “comprehensive strategy” that will ensure that any leakages from hotel quarantine “will have a one-day jump on us, not a week or 10 days”, he said.\\nAndrews said that people with the UK super-strain were infecting on average four other people, warning that the virus “will get away from us” very quickly if it is introduced to the Australian community.\\nThe measures are being considered by the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee, but Andrews said Victoria had “led the charge” and he is “confident” the measures will be adopted at national cabinet on Friday.\\nMorrison was less definite, but said the discussion among chief health officers had been “very collaborative” and “if they are in agreement” national cabinet will likely adopt the measures.',\n",

So that’s what we’re talking about, but the vaccine is recommended for use in all ages,” he said.\\nJohn Skerritt (left) from the Therapeutic Goods Administration announces the approval of the AstraZeneca Covid vaccine at a press conference at Parliament House on Tuesday 16 February. Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian\\nOn top of those 53.8m doses, we have also been promised at least 20m doses of the Pfizer vaccine, which has already been approved for use by the TGA and has been shown to be 95% effective in preventing disease.\\nAustralia originally secured 10m doses but this was doubled in February.\\nThis is enough to vaccinate 10 million people as it requires two doses to be effective. This will be the first vaccine rolled out in Australia, but the distribution of this drug is considerably more expensive and complicated than others, given the requirement to keep the product at minus 70C.\\nAustralia has also signed an agreement to buy 51m doses of the Novavax vaccine during the first half of the year, enough to vaccinate the entire adult population. Novavax is still undergoing clinical trials, so this deal may fall through, but current results suggest it is around 89% effective.\\nFinally, Australia is part of the Covax facility program, which is an international agreement in which Australia paid $123.2m upfront to have access to up to 25m vaccine doses as vaccines are developed and approved. As part of this agreement, Australia has provided $80m in funding for vaccine programs in the developing world.\\nThis program could help supply Australia with additional doses from nine vaccine candidates.\\nNo vaccine has so far been approved for use in children, with Pfizer approved for those 16 and older, and AstraZeneca 18 and above. It’s still unclear how important vaccinating this age group will be given low infection and transmission rates.\\nWhen will the rest arrive?\\nHunt said 1m AstraZeneca doses a week would be made available by the end of March, with the distribution of the drug beginning around the same time. The first doses administered were those shipped from overseas.\\nThere were fears that Australia’s vaccine supply doses would be trapped overseas after the European Union declared they would need to give approval before any shipments were exported. At the beginning of March, Italy blocked 250,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine to Australia under the EU’s export authorisation scheme.\\nBut Australian health officials say Italy’s action won’t halt the vaccine rollout, thanks to the ability to produce AstraZeneva onshore.\\nFew details on the delivery of the Novavax vaccine have been released, but this vaccine may be several months away given it is still undergoing clinical trials.\\nWill the vaccine be free?\\nYes.\\nWill the vaccine be voluntary?\\nYes, and the government has confirmed that not getting the vaccine will not affect a family’s eligibility for the family tax benefit or fee assistance with childcare. The “no jab no play” rules only apply to the National Immunisation Program vaccines, and the Covid-19 vaccine will not be included in this.\\nWho will get what and when?\\nThe federal government has unveiled a four- (or possibly five) stage vaccine rollout plan, with a fairly confusing naming system. Official start dates for these “phases” have not been released but Australia is aiming to have all of phase 1a and more than half of phase 1b – around 4 million people – vaccinated by the end of April.\\nPhase 1a: The first people receiving the vaccine are quarantine and border workers, priority frontline healthcare workers, and staff and residents at aged care and disability centres. In total this will cover about 678,000 people and will probably use around 1.4m doses of the Pfizer vaccine, with the government leaving a pretty comfortable margin for error.\\nPhase 1b: This is the first large-scale rollout to the general public. The following groups will be eligible: everyone over 70, other healthcare workers, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people over 55, adults of any age with underlying medical conditions which make them vulnerable to the virus, and certain high-risk workers including army, police and those working in meat processing plants. This will cover around 6.14 million people and use up to 14.8m doses of mostly the AstraZeneca vaccine.\\nPhase 2a: Next the vaccine will be available to people in their 60s and 50s, all adult Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and all other critical and high-risk workers. This will cover 6.57 million people and use up to 15.8m doses of what will probably be the AstraZeneca vaccine.\\nPhase 2b: This will cover the rest of the Australian adult population, around 6.64 million people using up to 16m doses. This will probably be the AstraZeneca vaccine, although it’s possible the Novavax vaccine may be available if it proves effective.\\nPhase 3: This will cover all Australians under 18 if vaccinating children is recommended at that point. This will cover 5.67 million people and use up to 16m doses. At this point, there is no vaccine approved for use in Australia on children. Pfizer can so far only be administered to those 16 and older, and AstraZeneca, 18 and above.\\nA doctor vaccinates a woman with AstraZeneca’s Covid vaccine in the Netherlands. Photograph: REX/Shutterstock\\nWhen will everyone be vaccinated?\\nThe government has stated for several months that they hope to have all adults who wish to be vaccinated immunised by the end of October. They’re sticking with that deadline, despite the start of the rollout being a bit behind schedule.\\nCan I apply to receive one of the early doses?\\nNo.\\nThe government has begun contacting people eligible for vaccination in phase 1a.\\nFrontline workers will have their vaccinations organised by their workplaces, given a large proportion are directly employed by the government.\\nAged and disability care facilities are now seeking pre-approval from residents or their families for the vaccine, in order to ensure the doses can be delivered quickly and efficiently once they leave subzero storage facilities on the day.\\nThe Queensland health department has also advised those in priority groups will be “identified ... based on your level of risk and invited to register for a vaccine, if you wish to receive one”.\\nThe exact details of how the vaccines from phase 1b onwards will be rolled out have yet to be released, but the federal health department has referenced a “national booking system” for the Covid-19 vaccine.\\nHealth minister Greg Hunt said the aim was for bookings to be as easy as possible.\\n“Our goal for the public is to have a very simple access approach. So, as you can phone your GP, you can phone the state clinic, or you can come through a single front door,” he said.\\nThe government aims to work with states and territories to ensure those who are a priority for vaccination are provided with targeted communications. Key industry groups, peak bodies and health providers will be important in helping to communicate with older or vulnerable groups about how to receive the vaccine.\\nThe government has so far invested $23.9m in a communications campaign designed to provide information about when and where people can get the jab.\\nShould I call my GP now to book?\\nNo, not just yet. As the government works on a booking system, and GPs are trained for administering the vaccine, clinics aren’t in a position yet to book appointments for vaccines.\\nCan I pay to get vaccinated earlier?\\nNo. So far, Australians are only able to receive a Covid-19 vaccine through official channels. Any group offering to sell early access to a vaccine is not authorised by the government, and likely a scam.\\nWhere will you go to get vaccinated?\\nOne of the defining features of the early vaccine rollout is the need for the Pfizer vaccine to be stored and transported at minus 70C.\\nAs such, the federal government has established around 46 hubs in urban and rural Australia. These are generally located in the major hospitals of cities and large regional towns.\\nPriority healthcare and border force workers will visit these hubs to get vaccinated, and doses for health and disability care patients will be picked up from the hospital on the day of vaccination and delivered by members of the trained vaccine workforce to the facility where it will be administered.\\nNSW Health has previously said, “once more vaccine doses become available from phase 1b, it is expected that one or more Covid-19 vaccines will be available for the wider population through usual immunisation providers, including GP practices, GP respiratory clinics and Aboriginal health services”.\\nThe federal government plans to establish about 1,000 vaccine hubs around the country. This process will be eased by the rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine, which only requires regular refrigeration during transportation and storage.\\nHunt has also stated that from phase 2 onwards pharmacists would also be assisting in distributing and administering vaccine doses.\\nWhat will the process of getting vaccinated be like?\\nAfter booking your time to be vaccinated you will probably travel to your local hospital, GP or designated vaccination centre.\\nAccording to the government’s vaccine rollout guide, you will first be “screened”, presumably to confirm you are healthy and eligible. You will then be given the first dose of the vaccine along with information about any potential side-effects and when you will need to return to receive your second dose.\\nYou will have to be monitored for a short period of time before you leave and your details will then be entered into the Australian Immunisation Register.\\nSeveral weeks later you will then receive a call reminding you of the date and location of your second dose. For the Pfizer vaccine, this will be three weeks after the first injection, and 12 weeks for AstraZeneca vaccine.\\nThe vaccination process will be repeated for your second dose.\\nYou may experience some side-effects after getting the Pfizer vaccine, but these will almost always resolve after two days, according to the TGA.\\nThey found more than 60% will experience fatigue, 50% will develop a headache, more than 30% will suffer muscle pain or chills and more than 20% will experience joint pain, but the regulatory body has ruled that the benefits of receiving the vaccine well outweigh the minor discomfort this may cause.\\nOf those injected with the first dose of AstraZeneca, 50% will experience injection site pain, headaches and fatigue, 30% may develop a fever or chills and 20% may have joint pains or nausea.\\nAgain, the majority of these side effects are mild to moderate and usually resolve within a few days. The second dose is associated with significantly less adverse effects.\\nDue to the unprecedented and ongoing nature of the coronavirus outbreak, this article is being regularly updated to ensure that it reflects the current situation at the date of publication.

       "  \"Uptake of the Covid-19 vaccine has been high among those offered it, doctors say, despite fears that vaccine hesitancy could undermine efforts to control the pandemic.\\nExperts have feared mass uptake of the jab could be jeopardised by widespread misinformation, concerns among the public about the speed at which the vaccine has been developed and approved, and lack of trust in vaccines and the pharmaceutical companies and governments calling for it.\\nEngland school reopening in doubt with ministers divided\\nRead more\\nSuch concerns have been compounded by the new, highly transmissible variant of coronavirus that is spreading across the UK, which will mean a greater proportion of the population needs to be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity.\\nBut for now, at least, it seems few are shying away from vaccination. “We’ve had reports from our members that despite inevitable teething problems – to be expected when delivering a completely new and complicated vaccine at scale and speed – the programme seems to be running well overall with very positive take-up rates, so far,” said Prof Martin Marshall, chair of the Royal College of GPs and a practising GP in east London.\\nDr Julia Patterson, founder and chief executive of EveryDoctor, a network of grassroots NHS medics, agreed. “I run a network of 26,000 doctors. The response so far has been overwhelmingly positive among those receiving the vaccine. Despite much disinformation online, the uptake is going well,” she told the Guardian.\\nCovid-19 vaccines: why are some people hesitant? (part one) – podcast\\nRead more\\nAccording to UK government figures, 616,933 people had received their first dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid vaccine by the week ending 20 December, with those over the age of 80, residents and workers of care homes and NHS staff the first groups to receive the shot.\\nDr Fari Ahmad, a GP, said a lot of elderly recipients are very happy to have the vaccine.\\n“I think they do understand how much of a difference it will make to them individually and they’re probably the ones that have been shielding, and it’s had a massive impact on them,” she told BBC Breakfast.\\n“As we move through the age ranges I certainly think there will be some vaccine hesitancy, but I would hope that people will have seen the benefits of it.”\\nDr Samantha Vanderslott, of the Oxford Vaccine Group, said that surveys have previously suggested acceptance of a Covid vaccine would be higher among older age groups.\\nA poll by YouGov in November showed that 67% of Britons were very likely, or fairly likely, to take the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine if offered, a figure that rose to 81% among those aged 65 and over.\\nCovid poses 'greatest threat to mental health since second world war'\\nRead more\\n“The acceptance in older ages has been higher in surveys and vaccination seems to have been going quite smoothly,” said Vanderslott. “How younger people will fare is a bit unknown but they will be far down the list and millions will have had the vaccine already, so the hope is that the worries about the newness and speed of development will decrease.”\\nBut Vanderslott added that more effort is needed to underscore the importance of vaccination in younger people, and offer clear and tailored messages to groups with particular conditions or situations.\\nProf Beate Kampmann, director of the vaccine centre at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine agreed that as the number of those who have been vaccinated grows, many of those wavering may decide to have the jab.\\nBut, she added, other factors may also play a role. “If there are going to be travel restrictions and people can’t go anywhere unless they have got this vaccine passport [if that approach is taken], I think people will change their mind quite quickly about whether they want this vaccine or not.”\",\n",
       "  'Canada, the UK and Chile have ordered the highest number of vaccine doses relative to their populations, according to Guardian analysis of the latest available data.\\nEach of these countries has procured enough supplies to give each person at least four doses. By contrast, the African Union and Latin American countries – with the exception of Brazil – have confirmed orders amounting to one jab each for less than half their people. Some vaccines require two doses to achieve maximum efficacy.\\nThe figures from Duke Global Health Innovation Center run to 25 January. They show that the EU and US have ordered the highest total number of vaccine doses, at 1.6bn and 1.2bn respectively.\\nMost of the EU, US and UK’s orders are for the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine. Most of Canada’s orders are with Novavax, and most of the African Union’s are with Janssen.\\nThe UK has ordered a total of 367m vaccine doses – more than five times its population – of which 100m are the Oxford vaccine. It has ordered 60m doses each of vaccines from Valneva, Novavax and Janssen.\\nWhen looking at vaccines that have already been proven effective in phase 3 trials, the data shows the UK has procured 247m vaccine doses from companies with phase 3 results, a rate of roughly 3.7 per person.\\nCanada, Chile, Australia and New Zealand are the only countries with a higher rate, with enough supplies from companies with phase 3 results to give their people at least four doses each.\\nThe UK has placed orders for a further 120m vaccines from Sanofi-GSK and Valneva, but these still await positive trial results.\\nGlobally, three vaccine manufacturers have agreed contracts totalling more than 1bn doses: Oxford/AstraZeneca (2.1bn), Pfizer (1.1bn) and Janssen (1bn).\\nThe data will increase concerns about the equitable distribution of vaccines, with high-income countries dominating the list of those with the highest agreed coverage. This month the World Health Organization warned of a looming “catastrophic moral failure”.\\nThe international Covax group, set up by the WHO to ensure new vaccines are shared equitably, has agreed deals for 1.1bn doses – less than half the combined total of the EU, US and UK.\\nTen countries or territories have now vaccinated at least one in 20 of their people, all of them high- or upper-middle-income states.',\n",
       "  'When will the Covid-19 vaccine begin to have an effect on the nation?\\nThe government has pledged to offer vaccines to 15 million people – the over-70s, healthcare workers and those required to shield by mid-February, and millions more by spring. This should slowly bring the virus under control although it will take many weeks before we can be sure the vaccine is having an effect. Numbers of daily cases of Covid-19 may drop but that decline could simply be due to impact of current lockdown measures. Only when hospital admissions start to reduce significantly will we be sure the vaccine is having an impact. Then there could be be a slackening of lockdown measures. Few scientists believe that will happen before Easter, however.\\nWhat will happen in Spring?\\nAfter the over-70s receive a dose, over-60s will be eligible, adding another 5 million people.However, these first jabs will then have to be followed up with 20 million second inoculations because there should be a gap of no greater than 12 weeks between the first and second administrations of the vaccine, scientists have warned. Once these second doses have been given, vaccines can be doled out to others.\\nWill the vaccine slow down the rate of transmission of Covid-19?\\nThis is one of the key questions that scientists will be seeking to answer over coming weeks. The vaccines now being administered are designed to protect people from severe side-effects of the disease. They were not developed to block transmission of the virus. Thus a person could be protected against serious illness but still carry the virus and spread it others. However, most scientists believe that the vaccines should reduce viral load in those inoculated and there should then be a reduction in transmission. The degree of that transmission reduction will be a key factor in releasing the nation from lockdown.\\nWhat will happen during the second half of 2021?\\nThe government has ordered sufficient doses of Covid vaccine for the entire population of the UK. However, vaccines do not provide 100% protection and not everyone will allow themselves to be inoculated. Lack of blanket immunity will therefore result in outbreaks of Covid-19 through the year and these could intensify next winter. At the same time, new variants of the virus may emerge and may require the manufacture of reconfigured vaccines to tackle them. Nor is it known how long current vaccines will protect against severe Covid-19 symptoms. As a result, most scientists believe annual vaccinations against variants of the disease will be needed for years to come.\\nDue to the unprecedented and ongoing nature of the coronavirus outbreak, this article is being regularly updated to ensure that it reflects the current situation as well as possible.

The health minister, Jens Spahn, suggested it would take months to vaccinate the population with a target of 55-65% to reach herd immunity.\\nA committee from the German Ethics Council, the Leopoldina (national academy of sciences) and the permanent vaccination commission at the official public health agency, the Robert Koch Institute, has been asked to draw up guidelines for “fair and orderly access” with about 30-40% of the population in higher-risk groups by age or health. That includes 23 million Germans over 60.\\nGermany has said it intends to reduce pressure on intensive care beds by prioritising people with a significantly higher risk, with distribution at first at bespoke vaccination centres and then through GPs.\\nThe next tier for priority will be those working in key public services, including healthcare and care home staff, and the emergency services.\\n“At the forefront are of course nurses, doctors and also people who belong to a risk group. However, that is already quite a large number in our country,” the chancellor, Angela Merkel, said recently.\\nFrance\\nLike Germany, France relies on a group of advisory committees which have been issuing draft guidelines for vaccination priority and a widespread public consultation campaign aimed at countering vaccine hesitancy in a country with a history of resistance.\\nFrance estimates that 6.8 million of its citizens are at especially high risk, including 1.8 million healthcare professionals and carers. In addition, about 23 million people could be considered vulnerable because of either age or chronic health conditions.\\nAlthough the WHO has advised considering higher-risk occupations in inoculation strategy, France has extended this category to workers outside healthcare, emergency services and care homes.\\nWith chauffeurs and taxi drivers suffering higher death rates than healthcare workers in France’s first wave of infections, they have been prioritised for vaccination. Five million other professionals would also be included because of their contact with the general public including retail workers, school staff, plus people working in abattoirs and in construction.\\nThe next priority groups for France would be those living in overseas territories lacking sufficient intensive care beds and workers in settings such as prisons or in the military, and emergency services.\\nHow will a coronavirus vaccine be rolled out to the UK population?\\nRead more\\nSpain\\nSpain hopes to receive about 20m initial vaccine doses under a deal struck by the EU, with the first consignment expected by late this year orearly next year, enough to give 10 million people the required two shots.\\nWhile detailed criteria are expected to be released in the coming weeks, the country’s health minister, Salvador Illa, has suggested that healthcare workers and the elderly should get priority – although in terms of numbers, the two groups, at about 10 million, account for almost all of the initially available doses.\\nIt is understood that – as in other countries – vaccinations will largely take place in local healthcare settings to avoid having vulnerable individuals go to hospitals.\\nItaly\\nWalter Ricciardi, a senior scientific adviser to Italy’s minister of health, told the newspaper La Repubblica that his country’s priority for vaccination would be health workers, elderly people and people with conditions that make them vulnerable, followed by the military and police.',\n",

There are 730 vaccination centres at the moment, with a further 180 and 100 more hospital sites scheduled to open this week.\\nThe first priority is to immunise care home residents. Although the UK government’s advisory Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) recognised this group as the most vulnerable to Covid, the need to store the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine at -70C in the long term has meant supplies have not been taken into most care homes. GPs are now being offered £10 for every care home resident they vaccinate by the end of January.\\nBoris Johnson said he could not yet say how fast the vaccination programme would be scaled up to the 2 million jabs a week he hoped for.\\n“I wish I could give you here and now any sort of elaboration on the figures you have already heard about how we hope to get up to 2 million a week and so on,” he told BBC One’s The Andrew Marr Show on Sunday. “I can’t give you that yet.

Sir John Bell of Oxford University, the government’s life sciences champion, told Times Radio that AstraZeneca would be delivering a further 450,000 doses on Monday. Under the approval process used to fast track the vaccine by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, every batch has to go through quality certification.\\nJohnson told Marr there were “a few millions more Pfizer [vaccine doses] still to be used. We are rolling them out as fast as we can.” Distribution was not causing delays, he said. Asked about reports of potential volunteers being deterred by the need for additional training and forms about “deradicalisation measures” and “fire drills”, Johnson said: “I think it’s absurd and I know that the health secretary is taking steps to get rid of that pointless bureaucracy.”\\nLast week, the UK’s chief medical officers warned there could be shortages ahead in Britain because of global vaccine demand. They backed the recommendation by the JCVI to delay the second shot from three or four weeks to 12 weeks so that as many people as possible could be given some protection with the doses the NHS will have.\\n“Currently the main barrier to this is vaccine availability, a global issue, and this will remain the case for several months and, importantly, through the critical winter period,” said a joint letter signed by the chief medical officers for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. “Vaccine shortage is a reality that cannot be wished away.”\\nIn a press conference last week, the deputy chief medical officer for England, Jonathan Van-Tam, said efforts to produce the vaccine could be made harder by a shortage of “fill and finish” materials needed to speed up the rollout across the country, such as glass vials.\\nMatt Hancock, the health secretary, said the first Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccinations marked “a pivotal moment in our fight against this awful virus and I hope it provides renewed hope to everybody that the end of this pandemic is in sight”.\\nBut, he said, while the most vulnerable were being immunised, “I urge everybody to continue following the restrictions so we can keep cases down and protect our loved ones.”\\nBoots and Tesco have offered to help with the vaccination programme. Tesco has offered the services of its distribution arm, which could include the use of refrigerated lorries and warehouses to move supplies.\\nBoots is opening three Covid vaccination sites, in Halifax, Huddersfield and Gloucester, set up with local clinical commissioning groups.

The health secretary said: “This crucial report shows vaccines are working – it is extremely encouraging to see evidence that the Pfizer vaccine offers a high degree of protection against coronavirus.”\\nThe data from Scotland was equally encouraging. While the studies in England looked only at people given the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, which was available from the first week in December, Scottish experts analysed data from both vaccines over a period of 28 days.\\nBy the fourth week after receiving the initial dose, the Pfizer and Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccines had reduced the risk of hospital admissions from Covid-19 by up to 85% and 94% respectively, according to a study by Scottish universities and Public Health Scotland.\\nAmong people aged 80 and over, vaccination was associated with an 81% reduction in hospital admission risk in the fourth week, when the results for both vaccines were combined.\\nThe scientists, whose work is available online but has not yet been peer-reviewed, said the results from the two vaccines should not be compared. There was more data on people who were given the Pfizer vaccine, while the AstraZeneca vaccine had mostly been administered to older people.\",\n",
       "  'T\\nhey are the nations that have been held up as shining examples of coronavirus management. In Australia, New Zealand and Taiwan, daily Covid infections are in the single digits and outbreaks are quickly suppressed.\\nBut there is one area where these nations lag well behind the pack: vaccination. Countries with some of the most enviable healthcare systems in the world – including Australia, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea – will not begin to inoculate until the end of February or later.\\nThe delay is deliberate. The millions of people already being vaccinated against Covid-19 will provide valuable data to those countries who have – for various reasons – decided to wait for more information about the vaccine, its efficacy and side effects before rolling it out to vulnerable populations and the public.\\nAustralia’s health minister, Greg Hunt, said on Thursday that Australia was proud to be part of this group of “the most successful countries in the world in dealing with” Covid-19, and that he would not be pressured to bring forward the start of vaccination.\\n‘Lots of double checking and re-examining’\\nA significant driver of the expedited rollout in some countries is the severity of their situations. The US registered a record 3,900 coronavirus deaths on Wednesday, with numbers surging in almost every state. On Thursday the UK’s death toll rose by 1,162, its second-highest increase since the pandemic began. The urgency for the vaccine in those countries is palpable, with hospitals and morgues struggling to manage the number of deceased, and healthcare workers who were burning out months ago.\\nWhy would you put people at risk when if you wait a bit longer, you can get more information?\\nJennifer Martin\\nBy comparison, most Australian states and territories have had no local cases of the virus for months, while there has been no community transmission in New Zealand since 18 November.\\nProf Jennifer Martin is a physician in Australia who is also a member of the pharmacology and therapeutics advisory committee of Pharmac, the sole purchaser for pharmaceuticals in New Zealand. She said people often asked her about the pace of the rollout.\\n“The reason it’s such a prolonged approval process in Australia and New Zealand is because there is lots of double checking and reexamining of the statistics, because if we make an error, it will become an error on a big scale by the time the drug is rolled out across a large population,” Martin said.\\n“It’s not that uncommon that the regulator might look at the data and say, ‘Well, it looks OK in terms of how it works in European people, but we’re quite worried about how this might affect Indigenous people, and the Asian population seem to respond differently too’.\\n“Australia and New Zealand are saying; ‘Why would you put people at risk when if you wait a bit longer, you can get more information?’”\\nA medical worker receives an injection with a dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine in Mexico Photograph: Daniel Becerril/Reuters\\nRegulators are already learning from those who have been vaccinated. On Wednesday, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published data on allergic reactions to the Pfizer/ BioNTech mRNA vaccine seen in the US between 14 and 23 December.\\nThat data will prove useful to countries such as South Korea, which has ordered enough vaccine doses to inoculate all of the country’s 52 million people, but is delaying mass vaccination while it observes possible side effects elsewhere. Meanwhile, New Zealand’s health ministry said regulators were waiting to “take into account the assessments of trusted regulators, such as in Australia, the UK, Europe, Canada and the USA”.\\n‘These people are helping us’\\nAn infectious diseases and vaccine expert from the University of Sydney, Prof Robert Booy, said the Pfizer/BioNtech mRNA vaccine, which is being issued first in many countries, has “five incredible advantages” over other types of vaccines.\\n“mRNA vaccines can be quickly developed, they’re cheap, they’re effective, they appear safe, and you can adjust them by putting in a slightly different antigen if the virus changes its spots,” he said. “But the overarching concern is, we’ve never used this type of vaccine before, so we have to do our darnedest to do the surveillance to check that it’s well tolerated.”\\nBooy said there was always a country that needed to be first with introducing any drug or medical device, and that no steps had been skipped, such as conducting phase-three clinical trials. This meant the vaccines were very likely to be safe, he said, but some countries, forced to choose between exponential deaths and overwhelmed health systems, or introducing a vaccine before having time to analyse the full results, had made the logical decision to issue the vaccine, starting with vulnerable populations.\\nEven Japan, which on Thursday reported a record 2,447 new cases and declared a state of emergency in Tokyo, is not rushing the rollout. Japanese media have reported that vaccinations will not begin until late February, with the first going to about 10,000 frontline health workers. Those over 65, care home workers and people with underlying health conditions will follow in March.\\nThere is a particular need to first build public confidence and trust in the Covid-19 vaccine in Japan. While Japan doesn’t have an anti-vaccination movement comparable to the UK and US, there is a relatively high level of vaccine hesitancy.\\nThere are other benefits to countries moving steadily with vaccination. Health authorities will have more time to sort the logistics of transporting vaccines, some of which require cold-chain storage, across vast landscapes including deserts, forest and bushland. Technology can be established to track doses across the supply chain and monitor for wastage. There is more time to train staff to administer the vaccine and run education and safety campaigns to ensure public trust.\\nMartin said people living in those countries waiting for more data before approving and distributing the vaccine should feel gratitude to those receiving it in places such as China, the US and UK.\\n“These people are helping us to get data, in the same way as any patient that’s in a clinical trial, and that’s really going to benefit everyone,” she said. “But at the end of the day, when I speak to my colleagues in these places like the UK, they say they’re so desperate for the vaccine that they would take it in their eye if they had to.\\n“They’re just so stressed, they’re on the frontline, they’re worried about catching and spreading it. So they’re just so unbelievably grateful to be among the first.”',\n",
       "  'Analysts are involved in an urgent effort to gauge the impact of Britain’s mass Covid-19 vaccine campaign and to pinpoint dates when lockdown measures can be eased.\\nMore than 3 million people – most of them elderly or vulnerable individuals or health workers – have already been given jabs. Now researchers are trying to establish when the first fruits of the mass vaccination programme may be seen as the government heads towards its target of immunising more than 13 million people by 15 February.\\nMost agree that the impact of the vaccine may vary widely regionally and among different groups. Nevertheless, it is expected the first indications of the jab’s success should become apparent in a few weeks.\\n“We won’t see numbers of cases drop significantly in the next few weeks but we should see the vaccine having an impact in our analyses of cases, then not long afterwards hospitalisations and then deaths should decrease noticeably,” said Professor Adam Finn, of Bristol University.\\nOne analysis released last week by the Covid-19 Actuaries Response Group – set up last year by actuaries, epidemiologists and longevity experts to study the disease’s impact on the UK population – painted a graphic picture of what lies ahead.\\nWritten by actuary John Roberts, it predicts that material reductions will be seen in hospitalisations starting from mid-February, and reported deaths in early March. In contrast, the impact on numbers of cases is likely to be seen sooner, according to the group’s analysis. However, the reduction there is likely to be smaller.\\nHow vaccines could affect the UK\\nSeveral key factors will influence the impact of the vaccine, says Roberts: the prevalence of the virus in the population, the effectiveness of each vaccine, and the take-up of the vaccine. If the virus is widespread, and the vaccine is not as effective as expected, then the programme will take longer to have an impact.\\nRefusal to be vaccinated could also affect case reductions.\\nNevertheless, several key forecasts can be made, he states. Firstly, over the next few months, the vaccine will only cause overall numbers of cases to drop by 10%-15% of current levels – because that decline is proportionate to the numbers being vaccinated\\nHowever, it is in the second category – hospitalisations – that the mass vaccination rollout will have a noticeable impact, and that is because the programme has been specifically targeted at the old and the vulnerable – those most likely to need treatment in a hospital. As a result, hospitalisations are likely to start to decline at the end of January and reach 40% of current levels by the middle of March.\\nThis decline will be less apparent for those admitted to intensive care units (ICUs). Once in hospital, the very elderly are generally not selected for such treatment, and so ICU admissions are likely to drop to only 65% of current use by early April.\\nHowever, it is the impact on death rates that will show the greatest effect of vaccinations, it is thought. The rate will not start to drop noticeably until late February but once the decline starts it should accelerate quickly until, by mid-April, death rates linked to Covid-19 will be reduced to below 20% of current levels. This reduction – in hospitalisations and deaths – suggests that the NHS, while still facing continued severe stress over the next few weeks, can expect to achieve stability by spring.\\nThis optimism was shared by England’s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, who told Friday’s Downing Street press conference he thought there was “a reasonable chance things will be a lot better in the spring”.\\nThe government is today urging the public to join a “national effort” by helping friends and family over 80 to sign up for vaccinations. The NHS has vaccinated about 45% of over-80s in England so far. Now Matt Hancock, the health secretary, is asking the public to sign up to three pledges to support the effort – to “help out” those over 80; to “join up” to clinical trials for Covid-19 vaccines and treatments; and to “stay informed” by keeping up to date with the latest NHS advice.',\n",
       "  'T\\nhere are triumphant scenes as lorries leave a vaccine plant in Pune, India, loaded with boxes that will prevent thousands of deaths. Adar Poonawalla, the owner and chief executive of the Serum Institute of India, poses on the tailgate of a truck, making the most of his company’s “proud and historic” moment as the potential saviour of the nation – and even a large chunk of the world.\\nPoonawalla’s factory, the largest vaccine manufacturing complex in the world, is the best hope for immunisation for people in Africa and some low-income countries elsewhere – which could save them from the ravages of the coronavirus pandemic. The Serum Institute has been contracted to supply the UN-backed Covax initiative, which subsidises low-income countries, with 200m doses of Covid-19 vaccines with an option on 900m more.\\nFor a heart-stopping moment last week, it seemed that vaccine nationalism within India might slam the door. On 4 January, just after the Serum Institute got approval from the Indian regulator for the vaccine – made under licence from AstraZeneca – Poonawalla was reported as saying there was a condition attached, which was that only India could have the vaccine for the time being.\\nThe following day, he clarified the “confusion in the public domain” on Twitter, saying “exports of vaccines are permitted to all countries”.\\nBut the lorries are headed across India for now and the episode underlines the tension as every country with cash wades into the fight for vaccines, putting manufacturers under unprecedented pressure to deliver for them.\\nAs affluent Europe and North America scramble to deploy the Covid vaccines they have pre-bought – amid accusations that immunisation programmes are too slow and the wrong people are getting the jabs – there has been not a single shot in the arm in many countries elsewhere.\\nThree vaccines have been approved in the west. Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna are expensive and need long-term storage at -70C. Pfizer offered to sell the vaccine to South Africa at a 50% discounted price of $10 a shot, but was told the cost was still prohibitive.\\nBut Oxford/AstraZeneca’s vaccine is stable at fridge temperatures of 2-8C and AstraZeneca has promised not to make a profit for the duration of the pandemic. It aims to provide 3bn doses this year, made in factories around the world under licence. It is the mainstay of the Covax initiative, which has now bought a total of 1.97bn doses of four different vaccines to distribute when they become available. The AstraZeneca vaccine accounts for most of it.\\nThe Serum Institute has promised to make 100m doses for Covax of the AstraZeneca vaccine and a further 100m of the Novavax jab – if and when that is approved. Covax has an option on a further 900m doses of one or the other of those vaccines.\\nDeliveries could start as early as February, said a spokesperson for Gavi, the vaccine alliance which is a partner in Covax.\\n“We anticipate being able to provide each participating economy with the first tranche – enough to protect approximately 3% of the population – in the first half of 2021. This process could begin as early as February, pending favourable regulatory outcomes and the readiness of health systems and national regulatory systems in individual participating economies.\\n“In terms of which vaccines will be rolled out to which countries, as well as timeframes, we hope to be able to share more on that very soon.”\\nSeven countries have now given emergency authorisation to the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine or the Serum Institute version: the UK, India, Argentina, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Mexico and Morocco. The Carlos Slim Foundation in Mexico is licensed by AstraZeneca to supply 150m doses to Latin America. These countries could take delivery right away.\\nBut other countries without a regulatory body will be waiting for the World Health Organization to give the green light, which is said to need data from the Serum Institute. In what sounded like a nudge, the director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said on 11 January it looked forward “to Serum Institute of India submitting full datasets for rapid assessment so WHO can determine whether we can recommend their AstraZeneca vaccine for international use”.\\nThe AstraZeneca vaccine will also be manufactured by SKbioscience in Korea, BioKangtai in China, Siam BioScience and the local conglomerate SCG in Thailand and CSL Behring in Australia. The Fiocruz Institute in Brazil has signed a deal for 100m doses of the Serum Institute vaccine, which it will put into vials in a process known as “fill and finish”.\\nIn an attempt to queue-jump, the Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, wrote to the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, on 9 January. “To enable the immediate implementation of our national immunisation programme, I would appreciate … the supply to Brazil, with the possible urgency and without jeopardising the Indian vaccination programme, of 2m doses,” Bolsonaro wrote.\\nBrazil is also now buying 10m doses of the Russian Sputnik vaccine. It is late to the party. At the very end of last year, Argentina took delivery of 300,000 doses and has been immunising healthcare workers. The Russians claim it is 92% effective, but the data has not been published.\\nA few middle-income countries have started vaccination programmes using the Pfizer/BioNTech jab. Mexico took delivery of 3,000 doses in December. Chile and Costa Rica have also started using the vaccine. Mexican officials have been to talk to their counterparts in Argentina about buying Sputnik.\\nChinese vaccines are also beginning to be used. Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates both gave emergency approval to the vaccine made by Sinopharm in December, which the manufacturers say is 86% efficacious, although – as with the Russian vaccine – the full data has not been made public. Turkey has bought the Chinese vaccine, and Morocco, Egypt and Nigeria have all been in discussions.\\nThere are other promising jabs on the way. Novavax aims to make 2bn doses for global use – but has not yet finished its trials. Covax has an option on 500m doses of the Janssen vaccine, which has the advantage of being one shot, but although results from phase 3 trials are expected within weeks, there are said to be manufacturing delays. It could be a major player, however.\\n“Johnson & Johnson aims to provide global access to Janssen’s Covid-19 vaccine candidate, if proven to be safe and effective. We have committed to producing 1bn vaccines doses a year starting in 2021 and have expedited manufacturing scale-up to reach this goal,” said a spokesperson. “We are leveraging a global supply base for our vaccine candidate, including facilities in the United States, Europe, Asia and Africa.”\\nDavid Salisbury, associate fellow of Chatham House’s global health programme and director of immunisation at the Department of Health until 2013, said that even if the amount of vaccine distributed across the world increased, not all countries would be able to run vaccination programmes for everyone who needed it.\\n“There’s a huge gap between a desire to have vaccine and political statements that your country will have vaccine – and actually having contracts either in place yourself or on your behalf and the ability to pay for it – and much more, the ability to implement it,” he said.\\nThe vaccination against Covid-19 is not like running childhood vaccination programmes, but more similar to the effort to immunise against the seasonal flu. Most low-income countries do not have enough clinics or databases to tell them how to access those at risk.\\nCountries that get enough vaccine for 20% of the population, which is what Covax hopes to provide eventually, will not be able to stop transmission. They will be in an “endless cycle”, said Salisbury – vaccinating health workers and those most at risk of dying, with more people getting older and moving into the at-risk groups all the time.\\nThe coronavirus is not going away, especially in low income countries. It could be argued the vaccines are just a temporary fix.\\n“Predicting the future for vaccine campaigns in all parts of the world is something many of us are already thinking about. Will this become institutionalised as an annual vaccination programme for industrialised countries? Unless this virus goes away I think the answer is yes,” said Salisbury. “But what will the appetite be in low-income countries for resources that are already under huge pressure to be used for prevention of coronavirus?”',\n",
       "  'I\\nn France, every child is now obliged to have 11 vaccinations. If parents want their children to attend school, or take part in many extracurricular activities, they must accept. There is no opt-out or concessions made to vaccine doubters.\\nOn Monday France’s government and health authorities are speeding up the country’s Covid-19 vaccine drive – a process complicated by widespread scepticism about the inoculation that has encompassed the usual global conspiracy theories.\\nFor weeks, polls have suggested up to 60% of French citizens do not wish to be vaccinated. As the government’s vaccine operation enters its third week, official figures show that as of Saturday at least 93,000 people had been given the jab – a much lower number than elsewhere in Europe, including the UK, Germany and Italy.\\nLaurent-Henri Vignaud, a science historian whose 2019 book Antivax, co-written with immunology specialist Françoise Salvadori, examines vaccine scepticism in the west since the 18th century, says we should not heed polls suggesting the French will refuse the vaccine.\\n“There’s a very big difference between what the French say and what they do,” he told the Guardian. “And polls whose methodology and questions can seem abstract do not reflect what happens when people know where they will have the vaccine, what it does, the how, when and why.”\\nVaccine doubters have existed as long as vaccines, but for years polls have suggested France has more than most of its European neighbours – an odd reputation given that immunology pioneer Louis Pasteur was French and is a figure of fierce national pride.\\nProf Jocelyn Raude, an expert on health behaviour at the École des Hautes Études en Santé Publique who has studied the anti-vaccine movement, says that as recently as 2005 polls showed 90% support for vaccines, “which seems incredible today”.\\nHowever, by the turn of the 21st century the seeds of doubt had already been sown.\\nIn the 1990s, a mass campaign to vaccinate French children against hepatitis B coincided with a jump in multiple sclerosis cases, though studies never found a convincing link between the two.\\nIn 1991, there was a medical scandal not linked to vaccines specifically when it was discovered that health authorities had knowingly distributed blood products contaminated with HIV to haemophiliacs in the 1980s. Several ministers were later charged with manslaughter.\\nHowever, Raude said it was the 2009 H1N1 scandal, in which the government massively overordered 94m vaccine doses at a cost of €869m (£780m), that fuelled today’s vaccine scepticism.\\nThe health ministry later cancelled more than half the order but the damage was done. Opposition parties criticised the waste of public money and accused officials of being in league with big pharma. In the end, 323 people in France died of H1N1, only 6m people were vaccinated and 19m vaccine doses were destroyed. An official estimate put the cost of the debacle at €382m.\\nRaude says the scepticism was amplified when some high-profile French celebrities began expressing vaccine doubts, relayed by newly emerging social media networks.\\nThen came the Mediator scandal. The diabetic drug, widely but wrongly prescribed to those seeking to lose weight, was linked to between 500 and 1,200 deaths over more than three decades.\\nMediator’s manufacturer, Servier, was accused of charges including manslaughter, and 12 people ended up in the dock in a criminal trial last year, including officials who were also paid as consultants of pharmaceutical companies. The company and the individuals charged deny wrongdoing. Judgment is expected in March.\\n“It was a tipping point. The Mediator scandal validated in people’s minds the idea of corruption between officials and pharmaceutical companies in France; that it was about business not health safety,” Raude says.\\nAnother cause, he says, is the lack of confidence in doctors and scientists.\\n“It’s not new for the French to lack confidence in political leaders, but there is a low level of confidence in the medical authorities in France. The effect of this is if you don’t trust the experts, you don’t follow their advice.”\\nVignaud says vaccine scepticism is less against the vaccine itself than those promoting it, reflecting a distrust of “politicians, high-profile doctors and experts and journalists”.\\n“France doesn’t have any more hard and fast anti-vaxxers than anywhere else, what it does have is … a certain dissatisfaction with the political class,” he says.\\n“There is a strong expectation of the state, but we are permanently disappointed: we see this with the vaccine programme: some say it’s too slow, others it’s too fast. Everyone is disappointed.”\\nThe film Hold-Up, a much lampooned and debunked epic claiming Covid-19 is a global conspiracy, has compounded the mistrust and been been shared by influential figures.\\nAmong those trying to combat the disinformation with facts and humour is the Facebook site Les Vaxxeuses. “Vaccines are the biggest medical advance … don’t let lies make you doubt the benefits,” the website says.\\nOver the weekend anti-vaccination proponents were dealt a blow when the far-right leader Marine Le Pen changed course and said she would agree to receive a Covid jab, having previously voiced her opposition.\\nMinisters are confident France’s vaccine programme will catch up in the coming weeks, insisting it is “a marathon, not a sprint”.\\n“Once access to the vaccine becomes a reality people will have the vaccine. They have had enough,” Vignaud says.\\nRaude agrees the government’s “slow steps” strategy appears to be working. “The government has been slow and careful so as not to frighten people … when French people see the benefits, they will do it.”',\n",
       "  \"The chances of an individual Covid-19 vaccine project producing a successful outcome are low, one of Britain’s leading immunisation experts has warned. “Science does not have a track record where most of our vaccine projects work,” Professor Adam Finn, of Bristol University said last week. “We have a track record where most of them don’t work.”\\nFinn’s warning came as doctors and epidemiologists stressed how difficult it would be to contain the disease until people can be immunised against it.\\nThe crucial point is that if individual projects have low prospects of success, many different approaches will have to be taken to find one that does provide protection against Covid-19.\\n“It is like the Grand National,” said Finn. “A lot of horses start off but only a few make it to the finishing line. And that is why we are going to need a lot of different vaccine projects to start off with – because only one or two are likely to make it to become fully fledged vaccines. This is not a one-horse race.\\n“At present, I would estimate there are at least 60 Covid-19 vaccine projects that have started up or are in planning. But the more there are, the better things will be.”\\nMost Covid-19 vaccine projects that have been announced so far have been for a type known as RNA/DNA vaccines. These involve taking genetic material from a virus and injecting into animals or human volunteers. This approach is quicker than other methods which typically involve creating pieces of a virus and using them to stimulate a person’s immune system against it.\\n'It’s a razor’s edge we’re walking': inside the race to develop a coronavirus vaccine\\nRead more\\nHowever, RNA/DNA vaccines – which are a recent development – have yet to be developed for use in human beings. “They are quicker to start up but we have much less experience with them compared with standard approaches.”\\nAll these projects have promise, Finn stressed, but most of those being launched to tackled Covid-19 were unlikely to work in the end. “The trouble is that we do not have a technology that allows us to be confident from the outset that a vaccine will be effective.”\\nIn addition, vaccines that do stimulate strong immune responses can also have adverse side-effects or may even make a disease worse. An example is provided by Dengue fever, which is spread by mosquitoes in Asia and South America. “A vaccine was developed to protect children against one type of Dengue,” said Finn. “Then it was found that it actually made them more susceptible to a second type of the disease.”\\nFor these reasons, vaccines have to be put through lengthy trials to ensure any dangerous side-effects are revealed. “We will have been cautious and not rush forward,” Finn added.\\nOn the other hand, it was possible that one of the projects would produce a vaccine that just sailed along, he said. It might turn out to be easy to manufacture, have no side-effects, produce a good immune response, while in trials it prevented volunteers from getting sick compared with those in a control group. For good measure,a factory would be ready to manufacture it.\\n“In those circumstances, you would have a vaccine in less than a year,” said Finn. “But it is almost certainly not going to happen like that. There will be stumbles along the way.”\",\n",
       "  'When Egypt’s health ministry sent out an invitation to doctors to be vaccinated against Covid-19, they neglected to make clear it was a clinical trial.\\nInstead, it assured them that two Covid-19 vaccines developed by China’s National Biotec Group, part of a state-owned conglomerate known as Sinopharm, had no side-effects and that “the minister of health was vaccinated today, and orders were issued to vaccinate all doctors and workers who wish to be vaccinated”.\\nMany were sceptical. “When my colleagues and I got that message, none of us participated, as we cannot trust it,” said one worker at a state hospital, who said there was a “lack of credibility” in the government’s approach to the pandemic and the vaccines.\\nThe doctor, who cannot be named to protect their safety, described Egypt’s extensive publicity campaign around the vaccines, featuring a well-known actor driving to a sunlit clinic to get his jab, as “government propaganda intended to boost people’s morale”.\\nAbout 3,000 Egyptian volunteers eventually participated in the trial, half the number that researchers wanted. That was in September.\\nA nurse awaits volunteers for clinical trials of a coronavirus vaccine in Cairo, 14 September.

Even with support from Gavi, the vaccine alliance, countries will need to source extra supplies to cover all their citizens and many will struggle.\\nRich countries leaving rest of the world behind on Covid vaccines, warns Gates Foundation\\nRead more\\nFor China, Sinopharm’s vaccines represent an added opportunity to strengthen relations and use the Middle East’s manufacturing and distribution capabilities.\\nSinopharm’s vaccines are expected to be part of national rollouts in Egypt, Morocco, United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. Both UAE and Bahrain granted emergency approval for their use on frontline workers before clinical trials ended.\\nEgypt has previously said it wants to become a production centre for the Chinese vaccine in Africa, while Sinopharm is to build a manufacturing plant in Morocco next year. UAE gifted Egypt at least 100,000 free doses as part of its quest to become a “global logistics hub” for distribution. This month UAE became the first country in the world to officially register Sinopharm’s vaccines, stating that one of the inactivated vaccines was found to have an 86% efficacy.\\nOn Tuesday Sinopharm announced that its Covid-19 vaccines are 79.34% effective. There was no comment made about the discrepancy with the UAE’s figure.\\nBahrain also recently announced its own rollout.

Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\\nSinopharm and its Emirati partner G42 said 45,000 people participated in phase-3 trials for efficacy and safety, although Sinopharm has yet to release the data. Part of the appeal of Sinopharm’s vaccines is they require storage at the standard 2C-8C (35.6F to 46.4F), in contrast to newer mRNA vaccines, which require a cold storage chain.\\n“Health systems in all countries are used to systems of storing vaccines at 2C-8C,” said Charlie Weller, head of the Wellcome Trust’s vaccines programme. “Minus-twenty or -70C presents a logistical challenge, not just for lower- and middle-income countries but any country.”\\nSinopharm’s chair Liu Jingzhen recently announced that almost 1 million people had received vaccines under an emergency use authorisation. “We have not received any reports of serious adverse reaction, and only a few have some mild symptoms,” he said.\\nA separate study cited data from Sinopharm’s phase-2 trials that suggested a 19% incidence of adverse reactions after two doses .\\nWeller stressed that any vaccines administered under emergency-use authorisation do not contribute data to clinical trials. “This is why clinical trials are needed: we need data to be analysed and to understand the efficacy and safety of any vaccine.

       "  'Israel’s coronavirus tsar has warned that a single dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine may be providing less protection than originally hoped, as the country reported a record 10,000 new Covid infections on Monday.\\nIn remarks reported by Army Radio, Nachman Ash said a single dose appeared “less effective than we had thought”, and also lower than Pfizer had suggested.\\nBy contrast, those who had received their second dose of the Pfizer vaccine had a six- to 12-fold increase in antibodies, according to data released by Sheba Medical Center in Tel Hashomer on Monday.\\nThe issue of some vaccines being less effective after a single dose rather than two is well known, as well as the fact that protection is not immediate. While the first dose can take several weeks to promote an effective antibody response, the second dose can trigger different responses, supercharging the protection. Pfizer itself says a single dose of its vaccine is about 52% effective. Some countries such as the UK have delayed administering their second doses to try to maximise the number of people given a first dose.\\nQuestions over the effectiveness of the vaccine were raised amid reports that thousands of Israelis were still becoming sick after receiving the vaccine, although the public health services head, Sharon Alroy-Preis, said that in most cases this was because the individuals had not built up sufficient antibodies after being inoculated before being exposed to the virus.\\nThe latest figures for Israel, which has implemented one of the fastest national vaccine efforts, underscore the huge challenges still being faced around the globe even in countries with aggressive coronavirus vaccine programmes.\\nAlready more than 2 million Israelis have had their first Pfizer shot, while 400,000 have had a second.\\nAmid warnings that 30% to 40% of the new infections were being driven by a Covid-19 variant first identified in the UK, the Israeli cabinet was meeting on Tuesday to consider tightening existing restrictions. Some analysts, however, have put the prevalence of the new variant at lower levels.\\nThe cabinet had been warned by Ash that the new variant was set to become the main source of infections in Israel within weeks.\\nThe new concern follows the release of data on Monday by Israel’s health ministry recording 10,021 infections the previous day, with a positivity rate above the 10% mark for the first time in more than three months, suggesting widespread community transmission.\\nThe rates of infection have undercut the sense of optimism that the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has tried to project around Israel’s vaccination campaign, for which he has taken credit.\\nOpening the cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Netanyahu said: “We are in a tight race between the vaccination campaign and the high infection rates in the world due to the mutation.” He called for a “last ditch effort” against the virus.\\nIsrael is in the midst of a third lockdown, due to end on Thursday. Other measures under consideration include closing the country’s main aviation hub, Ben Gurion international airport, to all except essential flights.\\nThe rise in new cases has provoked a round of finger pointing, not least at lax policing of the ultra-Orthodox community, where some schools have remained open and there have been large gatherings, including a wedding in Bnei Brak on Monday, described as “scandalous”, which drew 300 guests before being raided by police.\\nDescribing the impact of the new coronavirus variant, Alroy-Preis told Kan radio that the new variant appeared to be having a significant impact on infections in the ultra-Orthodox community.\\n“We’re seeing very significant and rapid infections and it’s really a race between this and the vaccine,” said Alroy-Preis, adding that one person who recently returned from the UK had infected 20 to 30 people.',\n",

       "  \"China is resuming visa processing for foreigners from dozens of countries, but only if they have been inoculated against Covid-19 with a Chinese-made vaccine.\\nThe move has raised questions about the motivations behind the demand, given China’s vaccines are not approved in many of the countries to which it has opened travel and that it will not accept foreign vaccines made elsewhere, including those approved by the World Health Organization.\\nBeijing had largely banned non-essential travel into China during the pandemic. Resumption of travel is a key driver for economic recovery and many countries are discussing carefully negotiated bubbles, or mutually recognised vaccination passports, as they implement domestic vaccine rollouts.\\nWhy home-produced Covid vaccine hasn't helped India, Russia and China rollouts\\nRead more\\nThe announcements made by Chinese embassies in about 20 countries this week vary slightly for each country but mostly pledge a return to pre-pandemic visa processing for some groups, so as to resume “people-to-people exchanges in an orderly manner”.\\nSo far it is open to foreigners from places including Hong Kong, the US, the UK, India, Australia, Iraq, Thailand, Croatia, Israel, Pakistan and the Philippines. Any prospective entrants must have taken either the full two-dose course of a vaccine, or a single dose vaccine at least 14 days before travelling, but the vaccine must be one of China’s domestically produced shots. Negative Covid tests and quarantine rules still apply.\\nThe statement issued by the embassy in the US said China would now allow the return of “foreign nationals and their family members visiting the mainland of China for resuming work and production in various fields”. It also broadened eligibility for non-emergent “humanitarian needs” travel, for family members of Chinese citizens or residents who want to visit for family reunions, care for elderly or ill relatives, or attend funerals.\\nChina first announced changes to visa processes for foreigners in Hong Kong, where China’s Sinovac is one of the vaccines already being administered to the public. Chinese vaccines have also been approved for use in the Philippines, Thailand and Iraq, but in several other countries to which China has offered the travel option there is no Chinese vaccine available.\\nThat meant people in Australia, for instance – who can only receive an approved vaccine, prescribed by a medical practitioner – were excluded from China’s offer by default.\\nPaul Griffin, an Australian-based infectious diseases physician, said it was possible Australian regulators would approve a Chinese vaccine eventually, “but I’m not aware they’re being reviewed by the TGA … and we certainly don’t have a purchasing agreement”.\\nAfter early criticism and suspicion over China’s lack of published trial data, there is much wider acceptance of Chinese vaccines now, although reported efficacy rates vary wildly. For vaccines across the board there a lot is still unknown about how well they block transmission, both in individuals and at a population level when more than one type is used.\\nChina now has five vaccines approved for either general or emergency use, including three that are also being distributed to other countries either through trade or aid. The push to supply internationally has been labelled a “vaccine diplomacy” campaign to boost China’s place as a global health contributor, with take-up mostly in Asia, Africa and South America.\\nIn a press briefing on Tuesday, Zhao Lijian, the ministry of foreign affairs spokesperson, denied the rule was designed to push other countries to recognise China’s vaccines.\\n“Our proposal … is made after thoroughly considering the safety and efficacy of Chinese vaccines,” Zhao said. “This is an arrangement made by the Chinese side unilaterally. It is a different thing from vaccine recognition.”\\nRobert Booy, an infectious diseases and vaccine expert from the University of Sydney, said Beijing’s announcement was “a good sign” for people returning to China for work, and it made sense to want those returnees to be vaccinated.\\n“I think all countries, China or not, are proud of a safe and effective vaccine, and would be keen to see a quality vaccine widely used, so I’d take the politics out of this and say I understand wanting to see a safe and effective vaccine used.”\\nBut the fact that Chinese-made vaccines were not available in many countries made things difficult. “I would hope the Chinese authorities would accept any reputable Covid vaccine,” Booy said.\",\n",
       "  \"The rush to immunise populations against Covid-19 could lead to the rollout of a vaccine that is not very effective and risk worsening the pandemic, leading scientists have said.\\nPoliticians and commercial companies are competing to be the first to license a vaccine, but experts say the world would be better served by waiting until comprehensive results showed at least 30-50% effectiveness.\\nMinisters announced on Friday that the UK would take emergency powers to push any vaccine through the regulatory processes with unprecedented speed before the end of the year. Donald Trump wants to be able to announce the US has a vaccine before tthe presidential election on 3 November.\\nA vaccine is vital to stopping the pandemic, but Prof Sir Richard Peto of Oxford University and an adviser to the World Health Organization, said the first vaccine would be bought and used all over the world even if it had low efficacy.\\nEven if it protected only a minority of the population, it would be regarded as the standard by which later vaccines would be measured. That could even lead to inferior vaccines being approved, because they would not have to show that they were any better.\\n“I think there’s a big rush, a somewhat nationalistic rush and also somewhat capitalistic rush as well, to be absolutely first to register a vaccine, and it will actually make it more difficult to evaluate other vaccines,” Peto said.\\n“We do need a vaccine that works and we need it soon,” but “we really do need quite strong evidence of efficacy”.\\nThere is huge political and commercial momentum in the UK behind the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, which is ahead of most other contenders in the world. Trials are taking place in a number of countries, including those with high levels of infection, such as South Africa and Brazil, where how well it works will become clear more quickly .\\nThe Department of Health said on Friday that it planned to take emergency measures to ensure the UK could licence a vaccine this year if it had sufficient evidence of safety and efficacy. Until 31 December, the UK would otherwise have to wait for the European Medicines Agency to approve a vaccine. Next year, post-Brexit, the UK will license its own vaccines and drugs.\\nIn its consultation document on changing the law, the government says the UK’s joint committee on vaccines and immunisation (JCVI) will be responsible for recommending that a vaccine that should go forward for licensing. That committee is chaired by Prof Andrew Pollard, the director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, who has said they may have enough data to give to regulators before the end of the year.\\nPeto is a member of the WHO’s Solidarity Vaccines Trial Expert Group, which is made up of leading scientists around the world who are advising on the establishment of the WHO’s trial to compare different vaccine candidates.\\nThe group said in the Lancet medical journal last week that a poor vaccine would be worse than no vaccine, not least because people who had it would assume they were no longer at risk and stop social distancing.\\n“Deployment of a weakly effective vaccine could actually worsen the Covid-19 pandemic if authorities wrongly assume it causes a substantial reduction in risk, or if vaccinated individuals wrongly believe they are immune, hence reducing implementation of, or compliance with, other Covid-19 control measures,” they said.\\nThey urged all regulators to stick to the WHO’s guidance, which says that no vaccine that is less than 30% effective should be approved. It recommends at least 50% effectiveness, but allowing for 95% accuracy that could mean 30% in practice.\\nThe Food and Drug Administration, the US regulator, has said it will abide by the 30% guidance, but some observers think it may come under political pressure to license a vaccine that falls below that threshold.\\nThe Lancet piece says trials such as Solidarity, which compare various vaccines, are a better way to proceed.\\n“In comparison with individual trials for each of the many different vaccines, a global multi-vaccine trial with a shared control group could provide more rapid and reliable results,” they write.\\nShare your story\\nShare your stories\\nIf you have been affected or have any information, we'd like to hear from you.

       "  'Final results from the trials of Moderna’s vaccine against Covid-19 confirm it has 94% efficacy and nobody who was vaccinated with it developed severe disease, said the company, kickstarting the approval process with regulators around the world.\\nThe US company is submitting the data to the regulators in the US, Europe and the UK for an emergency licence. It expects the Food and Drug Administration in the US to consider it at its meeting on 17 December, Moderna said.\\nThe UK has bought 7m doses of the vaccine, 5m on the day Moderna announced its interim result of 94.5% efficacy, and a further 2m last week. But supplies of the vaccine to the UK are not expected until March. Moderna, based in Massachusetts, has received $2.48bn in US federal funds and was a key part of the Trump administration’s Operation Warp Speed.\\nAlthough the firm has done deals around the world, the US will get access first. Moderna said it expected to have 20m doses of its vaccine ready for use in the US by the end of this year. In August, the US bought 100m doses with an option on 400m more. Moderna says it is on track to manufacture 500m to 1bn doses globally in 2021.\\nLike Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna has used novel mRNA (messenger RNA) technology to develop its vaccine, involving the genetic code of the virus rather than any killed or weakened part of it. The two companies have announced remarkable and very similar results. Pfizer’s final data analysis gave its vaccine 95% efficacy.\\nModerna becomes the third company to pass its data to the regulators for approval, after Pfizer and then Oxford University/AstraZeneca. The UK vaccine has 70% efficacy overall, although among a subset of volunteers given a lower dose, the efficacy surprisingly rose to 90%. That finding will now be trialled in the US, amid concerns that it may be linked to the younger age of the volunteers, who were all under 55 in that arm of the trial.\\nHowever, 70% efficacy is enough to be very useful in a pandemic, particularly in countries without the ultra-cold freezers, at -70C to -80C, that are necessary for the Pfizer vaccine. Moderna’s vaccine is said to be stable for a month at ordinary fridge temperatures once out of the freezer, but the cost will be prohibitive in many parts of the world. In August, the company said it was charging $32 (£24) to $37 a dose and defended its right to make commercial returns. The Oxford vaccine will cost less than £3 ($4) a dose. The UK has bought 100m doses of the Oxford vaccine, which will be a core part of its mass immunisation plans.\\nModerna’s phase 3 analysis involved 30,000 people in the US, half given the vaccine and half a placebo, and 196 of them became ill. Thirty people became severely ill and one died, but none of those had been given Moderna’s vaccine. The trials included substantial numbers of people in the most at-risk groups, with 7,000 people over 65 and more than 5,000 younger people with chronic diseases, such as diabetes, severe obesity and cardiac disease.\\nThe study included 11,000 people from black, Asian and minority ethnic communities, the company said, which is 37%, the same proportion as in the US population. There were 33 older adults and 42 people from BAME backgrounds in the final analysis. The company said there were no serious side-effects. The most common included sore arms, headaches and fatigue.\\nThe full trial data has not been released, but would be published in a peer-reviewed journal in due course, Moderna said.\\n“This positive primary analysis confirms the ability of our vaccine to prevent Covid-19 disease with 94.1% efficacy and, importantly, the ability to prevent severe Covid-19 disease. We believe that our vaccine will provide a new and powerful tool that may change the course of this pandemic and help prevent severe disease, hospitalisations and death,” said Stéphane Bancel, chief executive officer of Moderna.\\nStephen Evans, professor of pharmacoepidemiology, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said it was important not to pay too much attention to the exact percentage value of the efficacy.\\n“While the best estimate is 94.1% against all Covid-19 disease, the statistical uncertainty in this is such that the data are compatible with a true efficacy of about 87%,” he said. “This is, of course, still a very good efficacy. Similarly, the 100% efficacy against more severe disease is compatible with an efficacy of 90%, again, this is very good and is some evidence that severe as well as mild disease is prevented.”\\nThere was no evidence the vaccine performed worse in older adults, he said, which was encouraging.\\nAzra Ghani, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at Imperial College London, said it was good news that nobody given the vaccine developed severe disease. “Whilst this does not exclude some risk of severe disease after vaccination given the relatively small number of severe cases, these results suggest very high efficacy (>85%) against this endpoint,” she said.\\nShe looked forward to the full results, which would include some data on whether the vaccine prevents asymptomatic infections. “Efficacy against this would be very welcome as it would give the first indication of the broader indirect impact that widespread vaccination could have in reducing onward spread,” she said.',\n",
       "  'F\\nor Stacey Harris, the hardest part of organising vaccinations over the last couple of months has been fending off patients. “They’d be ringing up, coming into the surgery saying ‘I want my vaccine,’” she told the Observer.\\nBut last week that popularity evaporated. On Thursday, Harris – a healthcare assistant receptionist at the Faversham Medical Practice in Kent – found she could no longer find enough people willing to come in for their jabs.\\n“They want to know what vaccine they will be given,” Harris said. “And when you say it’s the AstraZeneca, they say: ‘I’ll wait for the next one’. It’s become an absolute headache.”\\nIt is a story being repeated across the nation in the wake of last week’s decisions by European nations to suspend the use of Oxford/AstraZeneca jabs over worries they could cause blood clots. Just as Britain seemed ready to ease out of lockdown, the very vehicle of our release – our massive vaccination programme – has been beset by crisis.\\nNor is this the only threat to the vaccination plan. It faces a second menace, also with its roots in Europe, in the form of commission president Ursula von der Leyen’s warning that the EU may halt vaccine exports to nations failing to show reciprocity by allowing supplies to reach the bloc. Nor did she disguise the fact that the UK would be a prime target for such a ban.\\nFor good measure, it was also revealed last week that the UK was facing a shortfall in vaccine supplies from India – about 5 million jabs – that could delay its plans to inoculate all the nation’s adults by summer. The prospect of a return to normal life in the sunshine suddenly looked more remote last week – just as a weary nation prepared to mark the first anniversary of its first lockdown.\\nBritain faces being deprived of vaccines which, in any case, are not trusted by an increasing number of people. So just how serious is the threat to our vaccination programme? Will lack of supplies paralyse it? Or will we end up with enough vaccines but with insufficient people willing to take them?\\nEuropean commission president Ursula von der Leyen issued a veiled threat to the UK’s vaccination programme last week. Photograph: Thierry Monasse/Getty Images\\nThese are important questions because vaccines are now viewed as a lifeline to a return to normality, a point that was summed up last week by Professor James Naismith, director of the Rosalind Franklin Institute in Oxford. Countries without advanced vaccine programmes were going to face a very difficult road ahead, he warned. “Vaccinations offer the only realistic hope to end the pandemic,” he added.\\nThe threat to the reputation of the AstraZeneca jab – the cheapest and easiest vaccine to distribute around the planet – is therefore an extremely serious issue and reveals the extent to which suspicion has dogged its introduction. In the wake of anecdotal reports of side-effects, French president Emmanuel Macron called it “quasi-ineffective” in the elderly in January, before recanting, while Germany’s chancellor Angela Merkel admitted it had an acceptance problem in her country.\\nEarlier this month, Austria and Italy withdrew batches after cases of adverse reactions were reported. Then, on Monday, German health authorities revealed they had found a small number of cases of women suffering blood clots after being given the AstraZeneca vaccine. Berlin ordered a halt to its use, to be followed by France, Italy, Spain and several other nations.\\nMany of these countries have since restarted using the vaccine, after the European regulator announced on Thursday it could find no causal link between it and blood clots – though Norway, Denmark and Sweden are still suspending it, while France has decreed it will only give it to those aged over 55 (odd given Macron’s previous questioning of its usefulness for the elderly).\\n“Any concerns about potential links between the AstraZeneca vaccine and regular blood clots can now be discarded,” said professor Gino Martini, chief scientific officer at the Royal Pharmaceutical Society. “The vaccine is playing a crucial role in protecting vulnerable groups from hospitalisation and death and helping to decrease infection rates.”\\nPassengers prepare to board a train at Montparnasse railway station to go to the provinces to avoid the third lockdown in France last week. Photograph: Chesnot/Getty Images\\nThe AstraZeneca jab remains under a cloud of doubt, nevertheless – a problem that could have widespread, worrying implications. “By having a message of doubt rather than a message of reassurance, that now plays into the hands of the anti-vaxxers. They are very well organised,” said Professor Beate Kampmann, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.\\nNothing says “lockdown” as loudly as hundreds of miles of traffic jams on all roads out of Paris and trains to the Mediterranean and Brittany full to bursting. And that was just what happened on Friday after French prime minister Jean Castex announced that the capital and 15 other departments – out of a total of 94 – would face new restrictions. By evening, traffic congestion more than 250 miles long affected roads leading from the capital. By Saturday morning, the city centre looked deserted. Covid-19’s third wave was now making itself felt.\\nAbout 21 million people – roughly a third of the French population – living in Paris and surrounding areas, as well as several departments in the north and south, are now affected. Unlike the three-month strict national lockdown that started this time last year, the measures are geographically specific and are aimed at halting the “third wave” of Covid cases that is sweeping the nation. Two-thirds of these are now the highly contagious “English variant”, that has seen admissions to hospital intensive care units soar. Worryingly, health chiefs report that many of the new patients are younger than in past Covid waves.\\nThe measures have been imposed at the end of a perplexing week. On Monday, Macron announced France would temporarily halt AstraZeneca vaccinations as a “precautionary measure” following fears of possible side-effects. The pause lasted four days. On Thursday, Castex was back on television reassuring the sceptical French that the vaccine was safe, before rolling up his sleeve for a jab on Friday.\\nSuch dithering is “bad, especially in France where anti-vax feeling is rife” observed one commentator, the Paris-based journalist John Lichfield. But not all the French-bashing criticism was merited, say some analysts. Medical authorities also argue that France is on track to hit its target of 10 million vaccinations by mid-April and is not – as has been claimed – “sitting on” vaccine supplies.\\nProfessor Sir John Bell, who was involved in the development of the AstraZeneca vaccine, disagrees, however. On Saturday he accused the French of damaging people’s confidence in vaccines in general. “They are sitting on a massive stockpile of vaccines they haven’t deployed yet and at the same time they have got a massive wave of the new variants coming across the country. You couldn’t make it up,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “If there are clotting problems associated with the vaccines – and I am not saying there are – they are at a very tiny level compared with the problems you get if you get the disease.”\\nBoris Johnson, who has seen his popularity scores rising recently, getting the AstraZeneca jab last week. Photograph: Andrew Parsons/10 Downing Street/EPA\\nThe contrast between the fate of the French and other EU nations and Britain is striking. While the EU shopped for vaccines like a customer, the UK took a more direct approach and went into business with the vaccine-makers, spending much more heavily to accelerate development, testing and production. The success of this strategy has been helping the government gain a “vaccine bounce” before local elections in early May, allowing the Conservatives to open up a small lead over Labour. It had previously let a huge lead slip as it botched the handling of Covid last year.\\nSeasoned pollsters have been noting a recent shift in the polls towards the Conservatives among voters aged over 55 – in other words, among those who have received the jab – and have been surprised at just how fast the effect seems to have happened. Usually, a prime minister’s personal ratings recover first, followed more slowly by party support.\\nIt has frustrated Labour, which has struggled to find a way of attacking the government’s performance without being seen as divisive in a time of national crisis. There is also frustration at the Tory attempt to brand the vaccine effort a Conservative success – Matt Hancock, the health secretary, recently tweeted the proportion of vaccinations in a message embossed with party branding.\\nAngela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, said the vaccine effort was a public sector success story, not a Tory one. “I do think there is an issue with that,” she said. “It’s not because the Conservatives have done a good job. It’s actually because our public sector workers, our NHS have utilised their existing skills and rolled it out through our local primary care services and local authorities. So I put the success back down to our scientists, first of all, our NHS and public services.”\\nHowever, there are many potential political traps for Johnson to navigate between now and early May. Dominic Cummings, the former chief adviser to the PM who left at the end of last year, is causing problems for Johnson. Last week, he accused the health department of being a “smoking ruin” in terms of parts of its Covid handling and he has re-emerged on Twitter. His demand for transparency over the government’s Covid response spells trouble for the prime minister.\\nLast week’s surprise slump in vaccine supplies, meaning new bookings for jabs were suspended for April, also shows how fragile the vaccine effort remains, due to the huge global demand and the complexities of its supply chain.\\nAnd there is also the potential problem, according to some pollsters, of the government becoming a victim of the vaccine’s success. The polling bounce has been so rapid, they think, that it is possible people may either begin to think about other issues – or if there are setbacks in the unlocking timetable, this could rebound heavily on the government. With senior scientists already warning about allowing foreign travel this summer, expectation management may become an issue for ministers.\\nFrance limits AstraZeneca Covid jab to over-55s as Europe treads cautiously\\nRead more\\nIt remains to be seen whether the vaccine problems that have beset Europe can be resolved and if the UK can maintain the formidable pace of its programme. Dr Gaurav Gupta, who heads the Faversham vaccination centre, said that his team had invited 140 people to book an appointment on one day last week. Only 40 accepted. “We were expecting a much bigger take-up,” he said. “At the very start, when we were calling patients, we were getting close to 100% take-up and nobody was missing their appointments.”\\nIn fact, there were signs before last week that enthusiasm for vaccines might be waning, added Harris. “You could already notice a change,” she said. “This week was a more dramatic change though. It’s social media – everything on Facebook. Everyone wants to know ‘how did you feel, how did you feel?’ They’re worried about side-effects.” On the other hand, after conversations with patients, some respond. “I tell them I’ve had the vaccine myself,” added Harris. “People do listen. But a lot have made up their minds already.”\\nIt is a view shared by Dr Marek Jarzembowski, a GP in south London. “All the stuff going on with Europe, and the fact that there have been delays in delivery of stock to the UK – when you start having one story after another, people start thinking – completely incorrectly – there’s no smoke without fire. But it’s very important that everyone gets vaccinated. It’s the way out of this.”',\n",

Clinical trials for the Covid vaccines approved so far show that they can substantially reduce the risk of becoming ill with the virus, but some people may still get infected and even be able to spread the disease. The same is true for a previous infection.\\nA Public Health England study of healthcare workers found that Covid infection led to about 83% protection against reinfection for at least five months. That still means almost two out of every 10 people could become reinfected within five months of their first skirmish with the disease. Some who became reinfected had high enough viral loads to pass the disease on. More encouragingly, less than a third of those who were reinfected had symptoms the second time around, compared with 78% the first time.\\nDeborah Dunn-Walters, professor of immunology at the University of Surrey and chair of the taskforce on immunology and Covid-19, run by the British Society for Immunology, said: “Your immune system could work at 100% and protect you from disease and the virus, or it could work less well and protect you from the disease, but not stop you getting and transmitting the virus on. Or it could work even less well, where you still get ill, but not as bad as you would have done.”\\nShould I still have the vaccine if I’ve had Covid?\\nYes. The immune system’s response to coronavirus infection varies from person to person. Age, genetic makeup and the amount of virus you were exposed to all play a role. The variability makes it hard to predict how well a particular person will be protected after infection. A benefit of the vaccines is that they have gone through trials to assess how well standard doses prevent disease, so there is far more certainty over the protection that they confer and the impact they will have on public health.\\nAnother point is that many people who believe they caught Covid last year have no proof of it. Is it safe to be vaccinated after having Covid? “There is no harm in giving the vaccine to a person who has had the disease – it will act as a booster,” said Dunn-Walters.\\nShould people who have had Covid be last to get the vaccine?\\nNo. This would complicate an already highly complex vaccination programme. Healthcare workers are at high risk of infection and many have already caught the disease. The vaccines will boost their natural immunity, making them less likely to become reinfected. Others at the front of the queue are older people. Their immune systems tend to be weaker, so even if they have recovered from Covid-19 they remain vulnerable and the vaccines will bolster their resistance to reinfection.\\nThe uncertainties about who is well protected or not after an infection makes it hard to justify sending any group to the back of the queue, regardless of age and health. “For the time being, everyone should be offered the vaccine, whether or not they have previously had the disease,” said Eleanor Riley, professor of immunology at Edinburgh University.\\nCan I see my grandchildren after having the vaccine?\\nAs vaccines are administered, public health authorities will get a clearer picture of how well they protect older people. Riley recommends waiting for about a month after the second dose to ensure that the immune response is as strong and long-lasting as possible.\\nThere is still some uncertainty about how well the vaccines will protect against some of the new variants of coronavirus, but scientists hope to have a better idea by the time the lockdown is lifted. “We very much hope, and expect, that it will be safe for people to see, and to hug and kiss, their grandchildren in the very near future. But we need to proceed cautiously,” Riley said. Dunn-Walters warned that grandparents could potentially still spread the virus after being vaccinated.\\nWhen do we get back to a more normal life?\\nRiley says she believes the route back to normality is to ensure, first, that everyone at risk of developing severe Covid-19 is vaccinated, and then that those at risk of developing symptomatic disease and long Covid are vaccinated.\\n“It is very likely that we can achieve this for the UK population by the summer for the first group – those over 50 years of age, and those under 50 with underlying health conditions – and by the end of the year for the second group, all other adults over the age of 18.”\\nThe first sign that the strategy is working will be a fall in hospital admissions and deaths, and if the vaccines prevent transmission as well as illness, then a fall in new infections as the vaccines are given to less vulnerable adults.\\n“This should allow life in the UK to return to something close to normal. However, if new virus variants emerge that are able to escape the vaccine, this could delay things. This will be evident if we start to see people becoming sick with variant viruses despite having been vaccinated,” Riley said.',\n",
       "  'Global humanitarian figures and NGOs have urged world leaders to urgently make Covid-19 vaccinations available to millions of refugees and others displaced by war, as the pandemic continues to overwhelm some of the world’s most vulnerable communities.\\nThe impact of the contagion has sharply intensified across the Middle East in recent weeks, matching soaring global numbers. However, it has been further amplified by drastically underresourced medical responses that cannot cope with the numbers of dying or seriously ill.\\nIn northern Syria and Iraq, where millions of people remain displaced or in internment camps, images of vaccines being administered in the US and UK have heightened fears that the collective efforts of global scientists will be focused on developed societies.\\nThe UN secretary general, António Guterres, has pleaded for the vaccines being rolled out across the globe to be made available to “all people” and that their distribution must be viewed as a “global public good”.\\nHis comments followed mounting concerns that a scheme to deliver Covid vaccines to poorer countries faces a high risk of failure and could leave at least half the planet without vaccinations for at least the next three years.\\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) is administering the rollout to poorer nations and said it aims to have 2 billion people vaccinated by the end of 2021. However, the target has been described by senior UN officials as ambitious and unlikely to be met without a serious upscaling of resources and political mobilisation.\\nThe UN’s refugee body, UNHCR, and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) have added weight to the concerns, imploring that refugees and migrants are included in governments’ vaccine allocations.\\n“In these times of pandemic and beyond, [we] … stand ready to support governments in their efforts to make health care available for all, through universal health coverage, a reality,” said IOM director general António Vitorino.\\n“Access to health is a fundamental right, but too often still those who need it the most – including migrants and forcibly displaced persons – are left out. If 2020 has taught us something, it is that ill health is a universal issue that does not distinguish based on nationality; so, to be truly effective, neither should our health coverage, including in upcoming Covid-19 vaccination efforts.”\\nMercy Corps, an international aid agency, said significant difficulties already existed in delivering basic necessities to places such as Yemen and Syria, where needs for a vaccine are great. “The risks and challenges ahead aren’t limited to vaccine supplies or maintaining a cold chain,” said the organisation’s chief executive, Tjada D’Oyen McKenna. “In conflict zones and places hosting refugees and internally displaced people, vaccines are likely to become yet another scarce resource that is contested – with the potential for escalating tension and conflict as a result.\\n“The international community must ensure through diplomatic pressure and on-the-ground support that vaccines reach all communities, including the most vulnerable and marginalised, in ways that prevent grievances and conflict.\\n“We also urgently need donors and governments to fund trusted community organisations to begin the outreach work now to ensure that misinformation is tackled and communities accept a vaccine when it does arrive. If we don’t act together as a global community, we risk leaving an entire generation of the most vulnerable behind.”\\nUNHCR said it has managed to maintain infection rates among forcibly displaced communities at comparable levels to local populations. However, official numbers of infections provided by governments in countries such as Syria are widely believed to be an extreme underestimation.\\nSenior members of the UN system fear that the distribution of vaccines will become a political tool, as have other forms of aid, such as food and medicine. Host governments are likely to be the primary means of entry of the vaccine.\\nThroughout the Syrian war, communities that have remained outside the control of the Assad regime have been routinely denied access to lifesaving essentials. Iraq’s displaced communities have had a similar experience.\\n“I don’t think we will get this vaccine as internally displaced people in the camps because we need a representative to source it for us,” said Mahmoud Sleiman, a resident of the Hassan Sham camp in northern Iraq. “In our case it is the government that should order for us, and I doubt they will get it in time. Even if they do, there will be corruption in the process and only rich people will get it. Poor people like me never will.”\\nUNHCR said global numbers of forced displacement crossed the 80 million mark in the middle of 2020. More than 50 million people were internally displaced, with potentially less access to international aid than those who had made it across international borders.\\n“My cousin got to Turkey and he says the Turks may get to him and his family in March,” said Ghassan Abbad, a Syrian who fled to Idlib province from government-controlled Damascus in 2016. “But here, only God can help us. There are so many dead and dying here. The curse has come to us, and nothing can lift it for many more months.”\\nKhalid Murad, a Yazidi member of a camp in the Kurdish north of Iraq, said time was against refugees and displaced people, who saw no real hope coming. “I don’t think this vaccine is only for the west but I think it will take a long time for Iraqi people to receive it. If Iraq receives the vaccine we will also get it, despite the fact that they don’t consider Yazidis as Iraqis. But under international pressure it will come to us eventually.”\\nAdditional reporting by Nechirvan Mando',\n",

       "  \"NHS leaders have raised concerns about the rollout of the coronavirus vaccine, with more than half of hospital trusts and two-thirds of GPs yet to receive supplies amid growing alarm over the new fast-spreading variant.\\nDr Richard Vautrey, the chair of the British Medical Association’s GP committee, urged the government to speed up delivery of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in order to save lives. Experts also demanded greater transparency from ministers on how many doses are available.\\nVautrey said: “We need millions of doses to be made available as soon as possible – urgently – because it’s the number one priority for GP practices, our patients and the nation, especially given the new mutant strain.\\n“GPs who haven’t got it yet are frustrated because they want to be getting on and vaccinating their patients as well. Their frustration is understandable. They want to protect their patients, especially their vulnerable patients, as quickly as possible.”\\nHospital bosses in England are also dismayed that, a fortnight after Margaret Keenan from Coventry became the first person to have the jab on 8 December, more than half of the country’s 135 NHS acute hospital trusts have still not received their first supplies. So far 57 (42%) of them have had a delivery and been able to start vaccination, the Guardian understands.\\nThere are 414 GP-run vaccination sites in operation in England, NHS England confirmed. Given there is usually one site per primary care network, each of which is typically made up of five or six surgeries, that means about a third of GPs are now involved in administering the vaccine. All hospitals and GP administering sites are expecting to receive the vaccine by 4 January as the NHS rolls it out in stages.\\nThe Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is expected to approve a second vaccine, from Oxford University and AstraZeneca, as soon as Monday or Tuesday next week. However, all those who had a single dose of the Pfizer version will need a second dose of the same.\\nWhitehall and NHS sources say current supply of the vaccine is “limited” and “constrained”. This is thought to be why groups of GP surgeries working together in primary care networks to deliver the vaccine privately complain they often get only 24 hours’ warning of a delivery, forcing them to arrange at short notice the required number of often frail, elderly patients to come in so precious doses are not wasted.\\nFive million vaccine doses were forecast to arrive in the UK by the end of the year after Britain became the world’s first country to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech version on 2 December. That would be enough to inoculate 2.5 million of the most vulnerable people – mainly over-80s and care home staff – with the two doses needed for full immunity, three weeks apart.\\nQuick Guide\\nHow does the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine work?\\nShow\\nHowever, there is confusion about whether that target will be met. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) declined to say how many doses had arrived and when more would reach Britain from Pfizer’s production plant in the Belgian town of Puurs.\\nAmid disruption at UK ports caused by countries’ fears over the new variant, a DHSC spokesperson said: “We have sufficient doses to maintain our vaccination programme as it continue to expand and we are working closely with Pfizer to ensure vaccines keep arriving into the UK, with robust contingency measures, so deliveries from the continent will continue unimpeded.”\\nGlobal demand for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine has increased in recent days after the US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency gave it the green light.\\nAt least 800,000 doses have arrived so far, with Boris Johnson confirming on Monday that more than 500,000 first doses had been administered to the elderly, care home staff and healthcare workers with underlying health conditions.\\nBut the Royal College of GPs demanded that ministers clarify the supply numbers so as many family doctors as possible can join the rollout and help expand the numbers being vaccinated, and that those that have already started know when their next batch will come.\\nProf Martin Marshall, the college’s chair, said: “Every vaccination site needs to know when their next supplies are arriving, with as much notice as possible, so that they can make necessary and feasible preparations.\\n“This includes being able to give patients as much notice as possible about their appointment, which will likely increase uptake.”\\nNHS sources say the vaccine deployment has acquired extra urgency as a result of the recent increase in the number of people infected and hospitalised with Covid-19.\\nPfizer said 21 shipments had arrived in the UK since early December, which are thought to greatly exceed the initial 800,000 doses, and had “been successfully delivered to our four nations across the UK”.

       "  'All adults in the UK could receive a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine by June if the pace of inoculations steps up to 4m a week from this month, according to the UK’s official economic forecaster.\\nThe Office for Budget Responsibility said in economic forecasts published alongside the budget that government public health advisers were assuming vaccine supply could reach 4m a week from 25 April.\\nHowever, the OBR also highlighted a faster vaccination scenario. “If the rollout speed increased further to 4m a week from March onwards, all adults could receive their first dose by June,” it said.\\nThat would be a month quicker than the government’s current pledge to offer a a first dose of a vaccine to all adults in the UK – about 53 million people – by the end of July. The OBR said that would be achievable at a rate of 3m jabs a week, taking in the requirement for second jabs 12 weeks after the first.\\nAs of Tuesday, 20.7m first doses of either the Pfizer or AstraZeneca jabs had been administered across the UK. Ministers want the first nine target groups to have had at least one dose by 15 April, before the programme moves on to cover the rest of the adult population.\\nVaccination rates slowed in the second half of February to around 2.3m a week, but the NHS is beginning to plan for a surge in doses from the middle of March. A letter sent by NHS England to vaccinators on Tuesday promised that “from 11 March vaccine supply will increase substantially”.\\nIt said the number of doses available would be roughly double the current levels, which could suggest a run rate in excess of 4m a week. Vaccination centres were being asked to start preparing to book a larger number of appointments from 15 March.\\nMinisters have previously hinted they expect the supply of vaccines to increase from March as more Pfizer doses become available. Last week Matt Hancock, the health secretary, predicted there would be “really bumper weeks” in March.\\nThe US Moderna vaccine is also expected in the next few weeks, although no final date has been confirmed for its availability.

       "  'Coronavirus vaccines may need to be redesigned this year to boost protection against a new variant that emerged rapidly in South Africa, research suggests, while past Covid sufferers may not be protected against reinfection.\\nResearch by South African government scientists reveals that mutations of the new variant, known as 501Y.v2 or B1351, make the variant substantially resistant to antibodies in blood plasma donated by Covid patients.\\nThe findings suggest it may be more likely to reinfect people who have already had Covid, and that vaccines being rolled out across the globe may be less effective. Since the variant emerged late last year, it has prompted travel bans around the world.\\nThe researchers found that the ability of antibodies to neutralise the virus typically fell eight-fold with the new variant, meaning that in lab tests eight times as much antibody was needed to disable the B1351 variant than older ones.\\nIn work that has yet to be peer-reviewed, the team at the National Institute for Communicable Diseases in Johannesburg found that the potency of antibody-rich plasma varied widely.\\nThe neutralising ability of plasma from some patients fell a staggering 64-fold when tested against the new variant, while for others the ability to wipe out the new variant was unaffected. Nearly half, or 21 of 44 patients, “had no detectable neutralisation activity”, the scientists write.\\nThe researchers warn that the new variant poses a “significant reinfection risk” and highlights the “urgent requirement” for vaccines that can be rapidly redesigned. Cases of reinfection with the B1351 variant have already been reported in South Africa.\\nAn eight-fold drop in neutralisation is the threshold the World Health Organization uses to decide when updates are needed for seasonal influenza vaccines, though the two infections are not directly comparable.\\nIf the results from South Africa are confirmed, the risk of the variant spreading more widely would justify planning for a “potential strain update” this autumn, said Trevor Bedford, who works on immunology and virus evolution at the University of Washington.\\n“I’ll be getting the vaccine as soon as I’m able,” he tweeted. “We have an amazing vaccine now that works against currently circulating viruses. And if it becomes necessary, this emerging situation can be dealt with through a forthcoming vaccine update.”\\nThe B1351 variant first found in South Africa is different from the B117 variant first spotted in Kent in September, though the two share a mutation in the spike protein which appears to make both more transmissible. The UK has recorded at least 29 cases of infection with the B1351 variant.\\nDanny Altmann, professor of immunology at Imperial College London, said the latest results were “disturbing” and could impact vaccines. “You need to pose the hypothetical question: are these effects big enough to subvert protection by the current vaccines? My current prediction is that, faced with the South African mutation, though probably not for B1.1.7, the answer would be yes,” he said.\\nProf James Naismith, professor of structural biology at Oxford University, said the findings were “not good news”, but urged people not to panic. “The real world human immune response is more than serum-based neutralisation. Of course we would rather neutralisation had occurred but this does not mean that the new virus will infect, make ill and spread from those who have already been infected with the original strain,” he said.\\nMeanwhile, further research suggests the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine does protect against the B117 variant blamed for the rapid rise in cases in London and south-east England.\\nScientists at BioNTech tested the ability of antibodies drawn from 16 vaccine trial participants to neutralise viruses carrying either the spike protein from the original Wuhan variant, or one carrying the same mutations as the B117 variant. There was no difference between them, suggesting the vaccine should be equally effective against both variants.\\n“The news should not be considered surprising, but is very welcome. It will be interesting to carry out the same experiments with the South African variant,” said Dr Jonathan Stoye, a virologist at the Francis Crick Institute.\\nEven so, further research is needed, said Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading. “While this study confirms that the antibody response is not blunted by the mutations in this variant, it does not assess the effect that these may have on T-cell immunity, so it remains entirely possible that they could indeed have an adverse effect on vaccine-induced immunity,” he said.',\n",

What is a mechanism to ensure equitable access?”\\nAn estimated minimum of 1 billion people across the globe are vulnerable to Covid-19. They fall into a number of categories: the immunocompromised, those with co-morbidities, the ageing, and frontline medical staff.\\n“So that says to you you need a lot of vaccine to protect even the most vulnerable in our society,” Halton says.\\nIt’s a problem the World Health Organisation is also working urgently to solve. This week it announced it planned to design mechanisms to ensure equitable distribution.\\n“While we’re looking for vaccines, unless we break the barriers to equitable distribution of the products, whether it’s vaccines or therapeutics, we will have a problem, so we need to address the problem ahead of time,” WHO’s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said.\\n“There should not be a divide between the haves and the have-nots.”\\nFor private companies, vaccine development is considered risky, protracted and hugely expensive.\\nCompanies are faced with the prospect of spending extraordinary amounts to develop vaccines, with a low likelihood of success.\\nCoronavirus vaccine trials could be done 'by mid-August'\\nRead more\\n“As a company, you are not going to spend the hundreds of millions and sometimes billions of dollars that are needed to develop a vaccine,” Halton says. “One, because you think your chances of being successful are about 5%. [Second], because you don’t even think there’s going to be a market for it.\\n“So this part of market failure is completely understandable. And that’s why [the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations] was set up.”\\nIt believes it needs $US2bn to develop three vaccine candidates in the next 12 to 18 months. It has raised almost half of that.\\nThe $2bn does not include the costs of manufacture or delivery.\\nThe coalition’s work emphasises speed. Each stage of the vaccine development process is compressed. Halton says the speed at which Covid-19 vaccines are being developed is “unprecedented”.\\nOne of the projects the coalition is funding is at the University of Queensland, where researchers are testing a molecular clamp technology they hope can help neutralise the virus.\\nThe coalition asked UQ researchers to begin working on a Covid-19 vaccine in January. Within three weeks it had produced the candidate now being tested.\\n“Like every researcher who’s looking at their baby, they are optimistic,” she says. “All I can say is I hope they’re right. I genuinely hope they’re right. It’s very hard for me to form a judgment about the likelihood of success.”\\nMore broadly, she remains optimistic.\\n“I think when we look across all the work that’s going on globally on vaccines, I do have some hope that we will end up with not just one successful candidate – ideally we would have three,” she says.\\n“I’ve said this now publicly several times: hope for the best but prepare for the worst. And if you hope for the best what you would do is hope to get three successful candidates.”\",\n",
       "  'I\\nt is 11am at the Newcastle Eagles basketball arena, and the queue for the car park is already bigger than for many home games. An army of volunteers in padded jackets and bobble hats wave through free buses from the city’s poorest suburbs, while discounted taxis disgorge their passengers, some with walking frames and sticks. One woman pushes her severely disabled adult son in his wheelchair.\\nSome have come in their Sunday best – three-piece suits, twinsets and pearls. A few bear chocolates, biscuits and thank-you cards for the staff. Many look anxious – Robert Graham, a dapper 76-year-old in a fedora and matching tweed jacket, says he’s avoided needles since a trip to the dentist many decades ago and is only here because Joyce, his wife, has made him. Joyce is excited. Finally, their time has come: they are about to be vaccinated against Covid-19 in perhaps the slickest vaccination operation in the UK.\\nWatching over the hubbub in a royal blue V-neck and striped tie is Christian Townend, chief executive of Newcastle’s GP federation. Along with his team, he is responsible for Newcastle becoming the first UK city to vaccinate all eligible care home residents in January and is now on a mission to inoculate the rest of the local population quicker than anywhere else.\\nThe competition is hot in the north-east, rather like on election nights, when regional rivals compete to be the first to declare a result, with nearby North Tyneside heralding its 20,000th vaccination last week and Newcastle aiming to reach the 25,000 milestone by the end of Sunday.\\nTownend served for 31 years as an army officer and was the medical planner for the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan, earning the Royal Red Cross award from the queen. Though managing a mass vaccination programme doesn’t involve the same level of peril, it is not easy to get 2,500 people vaccinated in six hours – Townend’s goal for Saturday – while keeping everyone safe. Barking orders military-style doesn’t work when you have hundreds of people volunteering and a cohort of infirm patients who can’t necessarily hear what you are saying.\\nChristian Townend, chief executive of Newcastle’s GP federation. Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian\\n“It’s all about consent and collaboration,” says Townend, diplomatically. Dr Antony Moore, chair of Newcastle GP services, calls the geordie approach “the industrialisation of vaccination”. He and Townend persuaded all 31 GP practices in the city to come together under one roof, on two basketball courts, in an operation that can easily vaccinate 30 people every five minutes. “No disrespect to other places, but some GP practices are just doing vaccinations at the local church hall every Thursday. You’re never going to vaccinate your most vulnerable people by Easter if you do it that way,” says Moore.\\nInside the arena, Dr Jane Carman, clinical director of one of the city’s primary care networks, is trying to do some mental arithmetic. As the guardian of the vaccine store, she is responsible for getting the vials out of the fridge at the right time. The Oxford/AstraZeneca medicine can only stay at room temperature for six hours, so Carman has to be careful to warm up only what she is sure will be used. “I’m desperate not to waste a drop,” she says, sticking handwritten “use by” labels on the latest batch heading for the basketball courts. “It is a huge responsibility. You do think: oh my God, if I drop this …”\\nAt least it’s not a Pfizer/BioNTech day: “The sums you have to do on a Pfizer day are phenomenal,” says Moore. The Pfizer jab must be used within three days of emerging from the mega-deepfreeze and has to be kept upright: a particular challenge when the GPs blitzed the care homes, carrying the precious vaccine in cool-bags padded out with sponges the medics bought from Sainsbury’s.\\nMost patients say they barely feel a thing. Others find the process more traumatic. On court one, Kate Stobart, one of the immunisers, is trying to calm a woman with dementia. It is her third visit – the first two had to be aborted after she lashed out, frightened. Stephanie Watson, the “drawer-upper” (technical term) who draws up the right dose in each syringe, holds the woman’s hand and tells her everything is going to be OK. Stobart manages to inject the needle and is enveloped in a big hug by the patient; “not very Covid-secure”, she concedes, but very nice all the same.\\nKatie Cagney gets her injection. ‘The NHS is amazing.’ Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian\\nAt 36, a museum worker, Katie Cagney, is one of the younger patients, invited as part of the clinically extremely vulnerable cohort. She hasn’t left the house apart from for walks since March and is very relieved to have been invited. “The NHS is amazing,” she says. “They’ve saved my life numerous times and now they are saving me again.”\\nPatience Kunonga, 40, is also a shielder. Originally from Zimbabwe, she works as a researcher at Newcastle University in the medical faculty, but was wary of the jab. “I was a bit hesitant because of certain media circulating online about the side-effects,” she says. She decided to get the vaccine after attending a Zoom Q&A session organised by the Ethnic Minority Independent Council’s Covid Aware project. “That really encouraged me to get it,” she says.\\n“What a warm bloody glow I’m getting,” says Gerard Reissmann, a local GP on his first day of vaccine duties. “What a breath of fresh air it is to be here. I’ve spent the last 10 months whingeing about how terrible things have been, the shortages of PPE, the government mismanagement, and now I’m here, helping people be vaccinated at breakneck speed. Fantastic.”',\n",
       "  \"“This is gonna go away without a vaccine,” Donald Trump said last week. “It’s gonna go away, and we’re not gonna see it again, hopefully, after a period of time.”\\nTrump’s personal insistence that a vaccine will not be necessary to defeat the coronavirus has prompted US officials to warn that Americans’ access to an eventual vaccine could be slowed – despite the cutting-edge laboratory work happening on American soil.\\nAnd the Trump administration’s approach to the search for a vaccine has seen it exclude the US government from an accelerating global effort against Covid-19, raising concerns that the endeavor could falter without official US support and leadership.\\nScientists around the world believe that humanity will achieve multiple effective Covid-19 vaccines in record time. In the wake of multinational fights against Ebola, Zika, HIV and other killers, the global infrastructure for taking on complicated immunization and vaccination projects has never been more robust, and American expertise plays an essential role.\\nBut even as research labs based in the United States move candidate vaccines into clinical trials and pharmaceutical companies reorganize US factories to prepare for large-scale production, the US government has turned its back on the global coalition fighting the disease.\\nJared Kushner and his shadow corona unit: what is Trump's son-in-law up to?\\nRead more\\nUnlike Britain, China, Canada, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Japan, numerous African countries, the World Health Organization (WHO), the Gates Foundation and the European commission, the United States did not send representation last week to a virtual global summit that raised more than $8bn for the coronavirus vaccine.\\nInstead, Trump – who for years has spread dangerous lies about vaccination – has tapped his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and others to lead what looks like a unilateral push for a vaccine that the administration has dubbed “Operation Warp Speed”.\\nThe details of Operation Warp Speed have not been announced, but the White House has set a target of having 100m vaccine doses by autumn, a goal a Republican senator called “amazingly ambitious” and that scientists decline to credit.\\nDonald Trump speaks during a coronavirus press briefing at the White House on 16 March. Photograph: Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images\\nStephen Morrison, who runs the global health program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, noted that the White House has signaled no plan to join an upcoming virtual global summit on vaccines set for 4 June.\\n“What the United States has chosen in these recent meetings – not to attend, and not to participate – it has chosen instead to begin talking about a sort of go-it-alone approach,” he said. “It seems to be taking an ‘America First’ approach.\\n“The risk is that this type of departure by the US fractures the international efforts and creates tensions and uncertainties and insecurities. That’s the risk.\\n“And if we fracture the ecosystem, does that slow us down? Does it make resolutions that are effective and universal that much more difficult to achieve?”\\n‘Everybody should be protected’\\nInside heavily secured laboratories at opposite ends of the state of Pennsylvania, scientists are pursuing two wildly different, and promising, paths that could lead to a coronavirus vaccine.\\nAt the Center for Vaccine Research at the University of Pittsburgh, a team led by director Paul Duprex is genetically grafting coronavirus spike proteins on to the measles virus to create a product that could quickly be manufactured in the hundreds of millions of doses from India to Indianapolis.\\n“It’s precisely why we as virologists exist,” said Duprex. “I’ve been teaching students about emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases for years – Ebola, West Nile, avian influenza, measles, mumps and so on. However, when you’re in the middle of a novel virus spreading rapidly from person to person, things are different.”\\nMeanwhile, at the Wistar Institute, a non-profit independent institute in Philadelphia, a team led by David Weiner has used DNA technology to devise a candidate vaccine whose long shelf-life and temperature stability could speed its distribution around the world.\\nA researcher at the University of Pittsburgh shows a Covid-19 vaccine candidate, a fingertip-sized patch with dissolvable microscopic needles, in Pittsburgh. Photograph: UPMC via Reuters\\nThe Pittsburgh team is now preparing to test its first human subjects. The Philadelphia team has already administered its candidate vaccine to about 40 people after encouraging results in mice, rabbits, guinea pigs and non-human primates. Hopes for a breakthrough are running high.\\n“This collective body of work, in this set of trials – those give us optimism that we’re likely to see immune responses” in humans from the candidate vaccine, Weiner told the Guardian. His lab expects to publish its first results from the clinical trials in June.\\nWhile the US government has largely sat out from the global fight, American labs, pharmaceutical companies and US-based foundations are fully engaged in the larger effort, linked with foreign partners in a common pursuit.\\nNo leadership and no plan: is Trump about to fail the US on coronavirus testing?\\nRead more\\n“This is a truly international problem, an international puzzle that we have to fix,” said Duprex.\\nThe coronavirus pandemic presents a quintessential global challenge, experts say. Even a good vaccine might not confer long-term immunity, meaning that the virus will not be defeated anywhere until it is defeated everywhere.\\n“None of us can accept a world in which some people are protected while others are not. Everybody should be protected,” said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the WHO, in a teleconference last week. “None of us are safe until all of us are safe.”\\nIn a best-case scenario, a vaccine to protect against coronavirus could begin wide production in the next 12-18 months, scientists say. The WHO lists eight candidate vaccines already in clinical trials – meaning doses are being administered to humans – and 100 more candidates now in the pre-clinical stage.\\n“This is not like Aids or tuberculosis,” said Paul Reider, a renowned research chemist in the pharmaceuticals industry who teaches at Princeton University. “This is an area where numerous vaccines will be successful, and they will be safe and effective.”\\nWe’re going to need four or five vaccines that are effective, being produced in all the vaccine factories in the world\\nPaul Reider, research chemist\\nDuprex is working with the Pasteur Institute in Paris and with Themis, a biomedical company based in Austria. Weiner and his team are collaborating with Inovio, a US-based biotechnology company that subcontracts manufacturing to the German-based Richter-Helm BioLogics.\\nEach Pennsylvania project is supported by millions of dollars in grants from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) foundation, which is headquartered in Oslo, Norway, and backed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the London-based Wellcome Trust.\\n“Making a vaccine takes time and is not trivial,” said Reider. “We’re going to need four or five vaccines that are effective, being produced in all the vaccine factories in the world to get it out there.”\\nBut Trump has attacked key international players in the effort, including the WHO and China, which has four candidate vaccines in clinical trials, compared with the three advanced by companies with ties to the United States.\\nAn engineer takes samples of monkey kidney cells as he makes a test on an experimental vaccine in Beijing. Photograph: Nicolas Asfouri/AFP via Getty Images\\nMorrison said Trump appeared to be playing to a domestic political audience by sending a message “that we are taking action on our own, we’re less reliant on others, that we will deliver faster and more furious, than our competition”.\\n“What we’re seeing is the application of that ideological approach to this particular crisis, and putting health security in that spotlight,” Morrison said. “We had not seen that up until now in these terms.”\\n‘We’re not sure what hesitancy is going to look like’\\nThere are ominous indications that the United States has been uniquely bad at flattening the curve of Covid-19 fatalities. The country may also be ill-suited to implementing a new vaccine program, analysts say, owing to the lack of federal standards for vaccination, a broken healthcare system, rampant inequality and a thriving community of vaccination skeptics.\\nIt is likely that any vaccine deployed in the United States will have to be rolled out gradually, since 330m doses cannot be produced at once. That warrants forward planning about how to protect vulnerable people, said Paul Delamater, a professor of geography at the Carolina Population Center whose work focuses on gaps in the healthcare system.\\n“The geography of risk for adverse outcomes for coronavirus may be quite variable,” he said. “One question we’re working on: who should get vaccinated first, under what kind of scenarios?”\\nAnother question the country can expect to face is how to achieve herd immunity when an unknown number of Americans can be expected to refuse the vaccine.\\nDemonstrators participate in a vehicle caravan with a sign reading ‘Trust in God not vaccines’ in Los Angeles. Photograph: Mario Tama/Getty Images\\n“We’re not sure what hesitancy is going to look like,” said Delamater, noting that the flu vaccine, which is widely available and heavily promoted each year, has only about a 50% uptake rate.\\n“I think that Covid will be different from the flu because there has been such a scare, and people will be tired of social distancing,” he said. “So I do think that uptake will be higher than flu, but … I worry hesitancy could be higher because of the speed at which the vaccine was developed and deployed.”\\n‘Salk could never have dreamed of these things’\\n“[Dr Jonas] Salk could never have dreamed of these things, because it really is different, completely,” said Duprex, referring to the celebrated American scientist who developed the polio vaccine in the 1950s. Duprex was contrasting the new style of vaccination, which uses genetic engineering to show the immune system something safe that it perceives as dangerous, and the traditional style, in which attenuated viruses themselves are used to provoke an immune response.\\nDr Jonas Salk, developer of the polio vaccine, holds a rack of test tubes in his lab in Pittsburgh in 1954. Photograph: AP\\nDuprex’s lab was one of the first research labs in the country to take delivery of samples of the coronavirus itself. Harvested from a Seattle patient, they arrived on dry ice on Valentine’s Day.\\nNumerous vaccine technologies will be needed to deliver a global solution in time, said Weiner, of the Philadelphia lab.\\nFor all his past skepticism of vaccines, Trump has touted a good one coming soon. “We are very confident we are going to have a vaccine by the end of the year,” he told Fox News last weekend. Duprex called that timeframe “probably tough”.\\n“Twelve to 18 months is not impossible, but it’s a big big ask, and it depends on everything going perfectly. And you know life, I know science – nothing goes perfectly in life. Nothing goes perfectly in science.”\\n“The idea is definitely aspirational,” said Weiner of the 12-18 month window, “and we should as scientists be as aspirational as possible in this and thinking about breaking down barriers, while maintaining focus on safety.”\\nDuprex mused on the history of US leadership on vaccine research, from Salk to Albert Sabin, who developed the oral polio vaccine.\\n“We have been so instrumental as a country” in the development of vaccines, he said.\\n“It’s weird to have all of that rich history in collaboration in biomedical sciences, and then think, at a moment in time, for reasons that are hard to fathom – that you want to go it alone, with a global problem.\\n“When collaboration is more necessary than ever.”\",\n",
       "  \"How big an impact will the approval of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine have?\\nThe Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is central to the government’s plans for ending social distancing in the UK and returning to some sort of normality. It has invested in seven different vaccines, but the biggest order is for 100m doses of the AstraZeneca jab, most of which will be manufactured in the UK. While the prime minister was jubilant that the UK was first in the world to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, he is now able to claim a British triumph. More to the point is the ease of use of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Unlike Pfizer’s, it does not have to be kept in the long term at -70C. Pfizer’s vaccine can be stored in a fridge for five days, but AstraZeneca’s can be kept for months at fridge temperature, which is 2-8C and will be easy to take to care homes to administer to residents, the first priority group for vaccination.\\nHow soon will I get my vaccine?\\nBioNTech criticises EU failure to order enough Covid vaccine\\nRead more\\nThat depends on a few things, such as where you are in the priority list set out by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), how many people can be recruited to carry out vaccination and how fast the vaccinating teams can work.\\nThe first priority group is care home residents and the staff who look after them and second is the over-80s and NHS staff. Then it goes by decreasing age: the over-75s, over-70s and over-65s. Next are people of any age with underlying health conditions that put them at greater risk, then the over-60s, over-55s and over-50s.\\nThis list makes up more than 25 million people. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, aspires to 2 million people a week being vaccinated, but that’s a big step up from the numbers so far. Even with the AstraZeneca vaccine being easier to deploy and local pharmacists and people with medical training who are not nurses joining vaccination teams, it will be a push. But if all went incredibly smoothly, most people in the first phase could theoretically have had their first shot by April.\\nWhat evidence is there to support a 12-week delay in getting the second dose?\\nThe Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), which granted temporary emergency approval of the vaccines, has said in its authorisation that the second dose of Pfizer’s jab should be given at least three weeks after the first, and the AstraZeneca vaccine at least four weeks after. That is in line with what was done in the clinical trials. But the JCVI has gone further in the interest of getting some protection for as many people as possible, saying the second dose can be delayed up to 12 weeks after the first for both vaccines.\\nThere is evidence from Oxford/AstraZeneca’s trials of greater efficacy among people who were given the second shot later – of 70% up to 12 weeks after the first. The JCVI says there is also evidence that is not in the public domain. Pfizer/BioNTech, however, have said in a statement that there is no evidence for the efficacy of a single shot of their vaccine beyond three weeks.\\nWorld leaders urged to make Covid vaccine available to millions of refugees\\nRead more\\nIt seems clear that the JCVI recommendation is a piece of public health pragmatism. The more people who have some immunity, the less illness there is likely to be.\\nIs one shot enough?\\nNo. It’s possible you may still get 70% protection beyond 12 weeks with the AstraZeneca vaccine – but the booster was always intended to be needed to lengthen the time that protection lasts.\\nWill everyone who needs a second shot be able to get it 12 weeks after the first dose?\\nThat may depend on the arrival of batches of vaccine. Hopefully by the time most people need a second shot, there will be a smooth delivery system in place and no issues around supply. But at the moment, the stocks of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine are running short, especially in Europe where it is the only licensed vaccine. BioNTech has warned of a gap in deliveries because it cannot keep up with demand. Some regions of Germany, where the company is based, are having to pause their vaccination programmes until they get more stocks.\\nShare your story\\nShare your stories\\nIf you have been affected or have any information, we'd like to hear from you.

Scientists would say that you should run a trial and not do it without the evidence. However, the Green Book, which is the NHS handbook for staff on how to use vaccinations, has already been updated to say that if none of the first vaccine a person was given is available, they could be given a dose of the other. Although “every effort should be made to determine which vaccine the individual received and to complete with the same vaccine”. It says: “For individuals who started the schedule and who attend for vaccination at a site where the same vaccine is not available, or if the first product received is unknown, it is reasonable to offer one dose of the locally available product to complete the schedule.”\",\n",
       "  \"Humanity will have to live with the threat of coronavirus “for the foreseeable future” and adapt accordingly because there is no guarantee that a vaccine can be successfully developed, one of the world’s leading experts on the disease has warned.\\nThe stark message was delivered by David Nabarro, professor of global health at Imperial College, London, and an envoy for the World Health Organisation on Covid-19, as the number of UK hospital deaths from the virus passed 15,000.\\nHow did Britain get its coronavirus response so wrong?\\nRead more\\nA further 888 people were reported on Saturday to have lost their lives – a figure described by communities secretary Robert Jenrick as “extremely sobering” – while the total number who have been infected increased by 5,525 to 114,217.\\nThe latest figures, which do not include deaths in care homes and in the community, put further pressure on the government amid continuing anger among NHS workers and unions over the lack personal protective equipment (PPE) for hospital and care home staff on the front line.\\nIn late March the government’s health advisers said that if UK deaths from Coronavirus could be kept below 20,000 by the end of the pandemic, it would be a “good result” for country. But with an estimated 6,000 people having already died in care homes from Covid-19 – a figure not included in Saturday’s official tally – the 20,000 figure is likely already to have been exceeded.\\nIn an interview with The Observer Nabarro said the public should not assume that a vaccine would definitely be developed soon – and would have to adapt to the ongoing threat.\\n“You don’t necessarily develop a vaccine that is safe and effective against every virus. Some viruses are very, very difficult when it comes to vaccine development - so for the foreseeable future, we are going to have to find ways to go about our lives with this virus as a constant threat.\\n“That means isolating those who show signs of the disease and also their contacts. Older people will have to be protected. In addition hospital capacity for dealing with cases will have to be ensured. That is going to be the new normal for us all.”\\nThe comments came as the former UK health secretary Jeremy Hunt said the only way forward was for nations to support a new global health system that would mean far more international cooperation between governments on health issues. It would also require richer nations doing more to support the health systems of the world’s poorest countries.\\n“I think global health security is going to be on that small but critical list of topics like climate change that we can only solve in partnership with other countries,” Hunt told The Observer.\\nIn a clear criticism of US President Donald Trump who announced last week he was putting on hold funding to the World Health Organisation (WHO) Hunt added: “Surely the lesson of coronavirus is cure not kill…It certainly does not mean cutting their funding (to the WHO).\\n“One of the big lessons from this will be that when it comes to health systems across the world, we are only as strong as the weakest link in the chain.\\n“Although China has rightly been criticised for covering up the virus in the early stages the situation would have been whole lot worse if this had started in Africa. International cooperation and supporting health care systems of the poorest countries has to be a top priority in terms of the lessons we need to learn.”\\nNabarro’s message is the second grim warning to come from senior ranks of the WHO in the last three days. On Friday, Maria Van Kerkhove, head of WHO’s emerging diseases and zoonosis unit, warned that there was no evidence that antibody tests now being developed would show if a person has immunity or is no longer at risk of becoming reinfected by the Covid-19 virus.\\nOn Saturday it emerged that doctors and nurses treating Covid-19 face shortages of protective full-length gowns for weeks to come, as anger mounts over failures to stockpile them. Gowns were not included in a stockpile list prepared for a potential flu pandemic.\\nAfter The Guardian revealed new guidance from Public Health England which instructs healthcare workers to re-use disposable equipment, the GMB, which represents NHS and ambulance staff, said support was “draining away” from Health Secretary, Matt Hancock.\\nShare your story\\nShare your stories\\nIf you have been affected or have any information, we'd like to hear from you.

       "  'Eleven hospitals in Kentucky will receive doses of a Covid-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer, perhaps as soon as Monday. Dr Nichelle Jadhav’s hospital is not one of them and she is confused. And she is not alone.\\nSaint Joseph hospital, where Jadhav works, includes a 433-bed facility in the state’s second largest city of Lexington, which regularly takes transfers of seriously ill Covid-19 patients.\\n“Working at a large referral center for Kentucky and seeing smaller hospitals on the list – I really don’t have an explanation for why those selections were made,” Jadhav said. “We all are confused about how those 11 hospitals were selected.”\\nFDA chief assures Americans of vaccine safety as US passes 16m Covid-19 cases\\nRead more\\nThe news crushed staff morale, said Jadhav. Doctors and nurses have watched one colleague after another fall ill with Covid-19 in recent months, and had pinned hopes for a brighter future on receipt of early vaccine doses.\\n“Obviously, we all understand everybody can’t get it all at once,” said Jadhav. But, without information on how the decisions were made, the team felt abandoned. “I don’t think anybody knew outside of the state government that it was only going to go to 11 hospitals, or where they were going.”\\nJadhav’s experience is one likely being replicated across the country, as states begin distributing a vaccine with plans that vary widely, lack federal funding, are often opaque and will not reach everyone even in early, limited populations.\\nThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Friday evening authorized a vaccine for emergency use, with the manufacturing partnership of pharmaceutical companies Pfizer and BioNTech expected to begin an initial shipment of 2.9m doses hours later.\\nWhite House officials have said Americans could begin seeing people get vaccinated as soon as Monday or Tuesday.\\n“The optimist in me wants to believe and hope that the largest mass vaccination program in the history of medicine will proceed without a hitch,” said Howard Markel, a professor at the University of Michigan school of public health. “The realist in me is seeing many, many, many roadblocks to that goal.”\\nThe first vaccine allotments are expected to go to 21 million healthcare workers and 3 million residents of long-term care homes. But states have wide discretion about precisely how to distribute the vaccines, and will be challenged by a vaccine that has severe storage requirements – it must be kept at -70C (-94F) – and a lack of funding as a result of a congressional impasse on new federal funding.\\nThose challenges hold the potential to repeat mistakes made in testing by failing to meet the scale of the pandemic and rebuild the public trust necessary to contain the pandemic, even as the vaccine’s authorization was heralded by experts as an “extraordinary” achievement.\\n“This is not just coordination between authorities, healthcare professionals, healthcare systems,” said Dr Bruce Y Lee, a professor at the City University of New York School of Public Health. “Clinics and the general population need to understand these things, because if something goes off it will throw off the whole system.”\\nThat does not mean success is impossible – any unprecedented campaign will have kinks, which still have the potential to be ironed out. General Gus Perna, the chief operating officer of the federal government’s vaccine development initiative called Operation Warp Speed, acknowledged as much on Saturday.\\n“We are not taking a victory lap,” said Perna. “We know the road ahead of us will be tough, we know situations will occur, but we will figure it out together, collectively, a whole of America approach to solve the problems.”\\nBut plans are likely to be disparate and wide variation in who will receive the vaccine first is already showing up in states’ public announcements.\\nHealthcare workers take part in a rehearsal for the administration of the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine at Indiana University Health in Indianapolis, 11 December.

Compare that to New York state, which has also suffered huge loss of life in nursing homes, but promised “staff at every hospital in New York state … will have access to the first allocation of a vaccine”.\\nIn Ohio, 88,000 of the state’s 98,000 doses will go to long-term care homes. In Colorado, the governor has said inmates will not be prioritized over people older than 65, even though the state’s distribution plan plainly called for the incarcerated, who have been hit extremely hard by Covid-19, to be ahead of older residents.\\nExacerbating challenges, the federal government has decided to distribute the vaccine based on a state’s total population, rather than their population of high-risk groups, which could lead to surpluses in some states and deficits in others.\\nThis is all in the face of the need for never-before-achieved adult vaccine coverage necessary to “extinguish” the pandemic, on the order of 80% coverage or higher, Lee and co-authors found in a recent paper published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine. The target is far more ambitious than any immunization level ever accomplished in seasonal flu vaccinations campaigns, which generally hover around 50% coverage.\\n“If you really want to stop this dead in its tracks, there are 300 million people or so – you need to immunize every man, woman and child,” said Markel. “That means you need 656m doses.”\\nChallenges are likely to be amplified by some characteristics of the vaccines. Pfizer’s vaccine will almost certainly be labeled for use only in children older than 16 for at least several months, there is only short-term data on the duration of immunity provoked by the vaccine, and a lack of data on whether the vaccine also prevents transmission of the coronavirus.\\nIn order to bring an out of control pandemic to heel, experts said, systems must work together. Americans must continue to wear masks, social distance, wash hands and avoid crowds while testing and contact tracing continues. In other words, it will take time – probably until the spring or summer of 2021 – to reach the levels of vaccination for which experts hope.\\n“It’s like telling a football team – you’re running out to play the Super Bowl – and the coach says, ‘Don’t worry, we have a gameplan,’” said Lee. If you don’t share that plan, it won’t help, he said. “Having a gameplan is not enough.”',\n",
       "  'Pharmaceutical companies should do more to transfer vaccine technology to prevent the poorest countries falling behind in the distribution of Covid-19 vaccines, according to an expert.\\nThe warning came from Dag-Inge Ulstein, the co-chair of the global council trying to speed up access to Covid vaccines for the world’s poor, known as the Act (Access to Covid-19 Tools) Accelerator. Ulstein, Norway’s international development minister, oversees the drive to ensure vaccines reach the poor – the Covax programme.\\nHis remarks were amplified by his global health ambassador, John-Arne Røttingen, who told the Guardian that the battle to create equal access to vaccines was “at a very important turning point”. Other diplomats fear that if the issue of vaccine distribution is not resolved, it will result in years of resentment between rich and poor nations.\\nSamantha Power, the new USAid director, has also admitted the scheme is not on track, and the WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, pointed out that only 25 people had been vaccinated in Africa compared with 39 million in rich countries, and said the world was on the “brink of a catastrophic moral failure”.\\nThe Act Accelerator is aiming to distribute 2bn doses of vaccines by the end of 2021 to world’s 92 poorer countries. Those countries can buy from elsewhere if they wish, but are unlikely to have the cash, and outside the scheme the price is likely to be higher.\\nIt is now forecast that only 27% of those living in poor and medium income countries will be vaccinated this year, but there are fears that something deeper may be going wrong. Detailed forecasts issued by Gavi, the global vaccine alliance, this week show Africa, a continent of 1.3 billion people, will only receive 140m doses by June through Covax.\\nNorway’s prime minister, Erna Solberg, and minister for development aid, Dag-Inge Ulstein (right) speak with international leaders online about Covid vaccines. Photograph: Hakon Mosvold Larsen/NTB Scanpix/AFP/Getty Images\\nAs of mid-January, according to the Duke Global Health Institute, more than 7bn vaccine doses had been purchased globally and the lion’s share –– 4.2bn – have gone to high-income countries. While high-income countries represent only 16% of the world’s population, they hold 60% of the Covid vaccines purchased so far. Canada topped the list, having purchased enough vaccines to cover more than five times their population. Most other high-income countries have more than 100% coverage, and some can cover their populations several times over.\\nRøttingen complained about vaccine nationalism. “The world’s efforts to create cheap vaccines for the world’s poorest countries has become very insular and out of proportion,” he said. “There are disputes over what are really minor differences over timing and scale of roll outs in different countries that all have started vaccination.”\\nHe also warned that unexpected challenges were delaying the drive to distribute vaccines being overseen by Covax.\\nHe said: “The difficulty is that we only really have widespread international approval for the marketing of two vaccines – the two mRNA vaccines. The challenge is that one, the Moderna vaccine, is very expensive, and the other, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, that one was first available and is now being rolled out in Europe [and] is moderately expensive in comparison with others, and requires a super-cold chain.”\\nHe added: “The price and the cold chain makes them not the ideal vaccines for a global vaccine.”\\nHe said: “We had hoped the other vaccines would be ready to go, but currently they are not. We are still waiting for general market approval of the AstraZeneca vaccine and even more importantly we are waiting for WHO pre-qualifications, particularly for the AstraZeneca vaccine, that are produced at the Serum Institute in India [SII] for Covax”.\\nCovax initially ordered 200m doses from SII, the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer, with options for up to 900m doses more of either the AstraZeneca/Oxford or Novavax candidates. It also signed a statement of intent for 200m doses of the Sanofi/GSK vaccine. In December it signed of a further purchase agreement with AstraZeneca for an additional 170m doses, and a memorandum of understanding with Johnson & Johnson for 500m doses of the Janssen candidate.\\nBut Covax can only distribute vaccines approved by the WHO, and neither the AstraZeneca nor the Johnson & Johnson vaccine have that approval (although AstraZeneca has approval in the UK).\\nThe degree to which these advance purchase agreements are binding legally is also contested. Serum, a privately owned company, has said a key priority is to provide for the domestic Indian market.\\nFaced by approval delays, Covax may announce later this week a small additional order from Pfizer and Moderna. But the costs of its vaccines were at one point treble the price per dose for which Covax budgeted.\\nThe delays and the clamour for a vaccine from voters are now pushing some countries to try to secure bilateral deals with pharmaceutical companies outside the Covax mechanism. South Africa, for instance, has ordered from AstraZeneca at reportedly double the price paid in Europe. It would form part of a portfolio of 20m doses. The South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa, has said he may have to raise taxes to fund this.\\nRøttingen said: “We had wanted a parallel rollout of the Covid vaccines globally, with the Covax mechanism ensuring rollout in the poorest countries. It has been made complex because the vaccines that had originally been chosen to be frontrunners, due to their price and logistical issues, are not yet ready.\\n“So now we are seeing middle-income countries understandably pressurised to make bilateral deals by their constituents, because vaccination programmes have started elsewhere, especially in Europe and the US.\\nA healthcare worker tends to a patient at Steve Biko Academic Hospital in Pretoria, South Africa. Photograph: Reuters\\n“The danger is that we are going to see an increasing number of bilateral deals struck by these middle-income countries that may not be in their best long-term interests. They may be costly and some of the pharmaceutical companies can potentially use this political pressure to increase their profits and encourage countries to go with bilateral deals, instead of the joint procurement Covax facility. That is highly problematic.”\\nHe said Norway was now trying to promote three principles to protect the scheme:\\nIncreased transparency on the vaccine deals, including the number of vaccines, the delivery date and price.\\nFull value for money on the collective funds that the world has given to purchase these vaccines for the world’s poorest so they are purchased at cost price, and not to make a profit.\\nIncreased production of vaccines can be boosted internationally by technology transfer and sharing by pharma companies to local and regional manufacturing firms.\\nHe said: “We need transparency and openness on these deals. WHO has the means, capacity, willingness to monitor the market, but they are not being given the data since these deals are not transparent. We need to shift that.”\\nEchoing the WHO’s Tedros, Ulstein also warned: “If all countries try to outbid each other in the fight for vaccines, we create an immoral race towards the abyss. We have a unique opportunity now to ensure that enough people in all countries are vaccinated, but then we must stick to the global approach and not fall for a vaccine nationalism that we have so long warned against”.\\nOne bottleneck appears to be slowness with which data on the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is being sent to the WHO. It is possible that manufacturers have prioritised market approval in countries where profit is highest.\\nOn the plus side, the arrival in office of Joe Biden means that the US has now joined the funding of Covax, the arrival of the US should help with the budget shortfall. China have yet to join, although Beijing is willing to supply its vaccines through Covax.\\nPower is appraised of the problem, saying immediately before her appointment: “Right now developing countries are not on track to get significant shares of the vaccine. The pool of money and the fundraising that has been attempted by the WHO and Covax Act, this vaccine initiative, has not produced the resources that are needed.” She also understands the need to explain to voters in why it is in their self-interest for other countries to be vaccinated.\\nThe difficulty is that voters in the northern hemisphere judge their governments largely against the benchmark of the fastest-vaccinating countries, such as Israel, and hardly spare a thought for a country such as Nigeria, where a population of 200m is waiting for its first vaccine. The incredibly insular media lens of most countries, including the UK, hardly helps.\\nNorway is trying to overcome this by showing a moral lead, saying it is likely to have three times as many vaccines as it needs for its population, and it will make this surplus available to the Covax. The EU has also promised to do the same, even if the detail is unclear.',\n",
       "  'People who recover from coronavirus have a similar level of protection against future infection as those who receive a Covid vaccine – at least for the first five months, research suggests.\\nA Public Health England (PHE) study of more than 20,000 healthcare workers found that immunity acquired from an earlier Covid infection provided 83% protection against reinfection for at least 20 weeks.\\nSecond shots of Covid vaccine could be delayed further in England\\nRead more\\nThe findings show that while people are unlikely to become reinfected soon after their first infection, it is possible to catch the virus again and potentially spread it to others.\\n“Overall I think this is good news,” said Prof Susan Hopkins, a senior medical adviser to PHE. “It allows people to feel that prior infection will protect them from future infections, but at the same time it is not complete protection, and therefore they still need to be careful when they are out and about.”\\nPHE recruited healthcare workers from hospitals across the UK and divided them into two groups: those who had coronavirus before and those who had not. Between June and November last year, the participants underwent fortnightly PCR tests for the virus, and monthly tests to examine the antibody levels in their blood.\\nOver the five months the researchers monitored infection rates in the two groups. They spotted 44 potential reinfections, including 13 symptomatic, among the 6,614 believed to have had Covid before, and 318 cases among the 14,173 who had no evidence of past infection. A previous infection, they conclude, provides 94% protection against symptomatic reinfection, and 75% protection against asymptomatic reinfection.\\nThe cases are referred to as “potential” reinfections because a detailed genetic analysis of both first and second viruses must be done to confirm a reinfection, but information for the first infections was often not available.\\n“The immunity gives you a similar effect to the Pfizer vaccine and a much better effect than the AstraZeneca vaccine and that is reassuring for people. But we still see people who could transmit and so we want to strike a note of caution,” Prof Hopkins said. In clinical trials, two doses of the Pfizer vaccine had an efficacy of 95%, compared with 62% from two doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine.\\nWhile the study is encouraging, it is unclear whether the same protection applies to older people. The study participants were aged 35 to 54 and would be expected to have robust immune systems. Older people tend to have weaker immune responses that are more short-lived.\\nAnother question mark hangs over the risk of reinfection from new Covid variants spotted in the UK, South Africa and Brazil, an issue PHE will investigate as the study continues this year.\\n“What one thinks of the numbers is very much a ‘glass half full or half empty?’ question,” said Danny Altmann, professor of immunology at Imperial College. “To many, it may be disappointing to put hard numbers to the idea that immunity to this virus is seemingly so variable and feeble that there is a greater than 1 in 10 chance of suffering reinfection, even at five months, let alone now, when many UK healthcare workers are more than nine months out from infections in the first wave.”',\n",

A total of 71% would choose to do so by October.\\nThe top three motivators for taking the vaccine were to protect oneself from catching Covid, to keep Australia safe from Covid, and to protect the elderly and most vulnerable.\\nThe top three barriers were that long-term side effects are still unknown, that “vaccines have been developed too quickly” and concerns about having an allergic reaction.\\nExperts warn against billionaires' plans for privately run Australian quarantine centres\\nRead more\\nOf all the people in the survey, 86% agreed that the Covid vaccines will help protect vulnerable Australians and 79% said they will reduce the risk of our health system being overwhelmed.\\nDue to low coronavirus case numbers in Australia, the population has little natural immunity and a high vaccination rate will be important to easing restrictions on economic and social life.\\nThe primary aim of the vaccination program is prevention of transmission, serious illness and disease of those who take the vaccine. Although herd immunity is also a goal, experts have warned that variants of Covid-19 may make it less likely to be achieved.\",\n",

       "  \"Millions of people across the UK at risk from Covid will be offered a single first dose of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, with a booster jab within three months, in a bid to return the country to some normality by the spring, the prime minister has said.\\nRollout of the Oxford vaccine will begin on 4 January following its approval for emergency use by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority (MHRA). The government hopes the vaccine, of which it has ordered 100m doses, will transform prospects in the UK and check the spread of the rampaging coronavirus variant which has caused cases to surge. Pharmacies as well as GPs will be able to give the jabs to those at risk.\\nBut the MHRA and the government’s advisory Joint Committee on Vaccinations and Immunisation delivered a surprise by announcing approval of a regime that was not trialled. Both the Oxford vaccine and the Pfizer/BioNTech jab which is already in use will be given to people as one shot, followed by another up to 12 weeks later, in order to extend some protection to as many people as possible as quickly as possible.\\nBoris Johnson said at a Downing Street press conference that the benefits from the vaccine would kick in within 21 days. “What that means is we can vaccinate and protect many more people in the coming weeks,” he said.\\nHe hoped that by spring of 2021, many coronavirus restrictions would be able to be lifted. “If we’re right and the vaccination programme does have the positive effects that we think it can have, and I stress these are ifs, then clearly a lot of the non-pharmaceutical interventions … will recede into the past,” he said. “We’ll be able to do things very differently.”\\nThe prime minister added that the public may need to carry on with “basic disciplines” such as washing hands and wearing masks “for a while after”.\\nThe approval of the vaccine by the MHRA after weeks of examining trial data was greeted with excitement and relief by experts. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine already in use needs to be stored in the long-term at -70C and is hard to deploy. The Oxford vaccine, however, can be kept in a normal fridge at 2-8C and is easily transported from UK factories, meaning it will not have to be kept in central hospital and community hubs, enabling a swift rollout to GP practices and care homes.\\nAmid the widespread praise for Oxford University and AstraZeneca in gaining UK approval for a vaccine that is vital to the global prospects of ending the pandemic because of its low cost and normal refrigeration, some experts were anxious at the proposed mode of use. They said it was pragmatic to try to ensure as many people as possible had a first shot, giving them some protection, but that there were unanswered questions. These include the evidence for extending the time between injections to 12 weeks, which could lead to some people not returning for the second dose.\\nPfizer/BioNTech said that their vaccine was not designed to be used in two shots 12 weeks apart. In a statement, the firms said there was no evidence the first shot continued to work beyond three weeks.\\n“Data from the phase 3 study demonstrated that, although partial protection from the vaccine appears to begin as early as 12 days after the first dose, two doses of the vaccine are required to provide the maximum protection against the disease, a vaccine efficacy of 95%. There are no data to demonstrate that protection after the first dose is sustained after 21 days,” they said.\\nThe decision to approve the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine followed “rigorous clinical trials and a thorough analysis of the data by experts at the MHRA, which has concluded that the vaccine has met its strict standards of safety, quality and effectiveness”, the DHSC said.\\nAstraZeneca said its vaccine would be made available to some of the poorest regions of the world at a low cost and was not being manufactured for profit.\\nTalking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, its chief executive, Pascal Soriot, said the company could provide the UK with as many as 2m doses a week and would start shipping the first doses “today or tomorrow”.\\nHe said: “Vaccination will start next week and we will get to 1m a week, and beyond that a week, very rapidly. The good news with this is we are going to be able to inject a lot of people with one dose very quickly, provide them with a reasonably good dose of protection until they get their second dose two to three months later. That will enable us to protect many more people because we can wait two to three months for the second dose.”\\nInside Oxford’s coronavirus vaccine development\\nRead more\\nMatt Hancock, the UK health secretary, said every adult in the UK could eventually be offered vaccination.\\nSpeaking to BBC Breakfast, he said: “Because we’ve got enough of this vaccine on order to vaccinate the whole population – we’ve got 100m doses on order – add that to the 30m doses of Pfizer and that’s enough for two doses for the entire population.\\n“So I can now say with confidence that we can vaccinate everyone, except of course for children because this vaccine has not been trialled on children, and anyway children are much, much less likely to have symptoms from the disease.”\\n00:47\\nOxford Covid vaccine approval shows 'way out' of pandemic, says Hancock – video\\nAppraisal of the Oxford vaccine has taken longer than it did for the Pfizer/BioNTech product, which the UK was the first country to approve on 2 December. The dossier of testing and trial results for the Oxford vaccine was more complicated.\\nPfizer/BioNTech, whose vaccine is based on novel mRNA technology, had clear results, with 95% efficacy from a single international trial involving 43,000 people. Oxford/AstraZeneca had 62% efficacy in their largest trial, of 11,636 people, but 90% efficacy in a small additional sub-group in the UK numbering 2,741 who were given half a dose of the vaccine followed by a whole dose four weeks later.\\nThe MHRA in effect dismissed the finding from the trials that there was 90% efficacy in that subset, which was made up of fewer than 3,000 people in the UK, who were mostly under the age of 55, so was not typical of the population’s most vulnerable. However, the MHRA said it was not the age of the participants that caused the high efficacy rate. Instead, it suggested it may have been because there was a longer gap between the administration of the first and second doses of vaccine. More details of their assessment was to come, the authority said.\\nOverall, the MHRA said, the efficacy of the vaccine reached about 70% between three weeks and 12 weeks, when given as a single standard dose. The second dose, not later than 12 weeks afterwards, was necessary because the effect may not last without the booster shot, it said.\\nThe MHRA acknowledged there was limited data on the effects of the vaccine in elderly people. Ongoing trials in the UK and US will supply more evidence, but it said it was satisfied the vaccine was safe and effective in the older population.\\nThe researchers have pointed out that none of the volunteers in the trials who had the vaccine became seriously ill or were admitted to hospital.\\nProf Andrew Pollard, the director of the Oxford Vaccine Group and the chief investigator of the Oxford trial, said: “The regulator’s assessment that this is a safe and effective vaccine is a landmark moment, and an endorsement of the huge effort from a devoted international team of researchers and our dedicated trial participants.\\n“Though this is just the beginning, we will start to get ahead of the pandemic, protect health and economies when the vulnerable are vaccinated everywhere, as many as possible as soon possible.”\\nThe Labour leader, Keir Starmer, tweeted: “We now need a national effort to get vaccinations delivered across the country.”\\nJonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, welcomed the news, tweeting: “Now let’s go hell for leather to get jabs rolled out. We’ve seen how more virus circulating means opportunities for variants to emerge. This is now a race against time. We need vaccination ramped up especially for NHS staff urgently.”\\nJohnson said the UK had already vaccinated more than 800,000 people with the Pfizer/BioNTech jab.\",\n",

       "  'A Belgian minister has blown the lid off a sensitive and commercial secret – the price that the EU has agreed to pay for the leading Covid vaccines.\\nBelgium’s budget state secretary, Eva De Bleeker, posted the price list on Twitter, with the amounts of each vaccine that her country intends to buy from the EU. The tweet was quickly deleted, but not soon enough to prevent interested parties taking screenshots, which have now made it public knowledge.\\nEva De Bleeker posted the price list on Twitter.\\nWhile campaigners for access to medicines were delighted at the transparency, pharmaceutical companies were not. Pfizer complained of a breach of confidentiality. “These prices are covered by a confidentiality clause in the contract with the European commission,” said Elisabeth Schraepen, the US drugmaker’s spokeswoman for the Benelux region to the Belgian daily Le Soir.\\nThe price list revealed that the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is the cheapest and Moderna is the most expensive – as was already known. But the details allow countries that may be negotiating with the vaccine manufacturers to take a harder line.\\nThis is the list of what the EU is paying:\\nOxford/AstraZeneca: €1.78 (£1.61).\\nJohnson & Johnson: $8.50 (£6.30).\\nSanofi/GSK: €7.56.\\nPfizer/BioNTech: €12.\\nCureVac: €10.\\nModerna: $18.\\nEvery country in the world has an interest in mass vaccination against Covid and there is a big effort to put together a programme to ensure all countries can access enough to vaccinate the vulnerable. But drug and vaccine prices have always been very closely guarded commercial secrets.\\n\\n“We can’t say anything about this case, everything about vaccines and prices are covered by confidentiality clauses, in the interests of society and also in the interests of negotiations ongoing,” said a spokesman for the European commission at a news briefing.\\nBelgium is buying more than 33m vaccines for a total of €279m (£253m).\\nThe UK, which is not part of the EU scheme, has secured 357m doses of seven different vaccines, including 40m doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech, which was authorised for use in the UK before the rest of the world. It also has 100m doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine.\\nA spokesperson for the British government said: “The cost of each vaccine secured by the government was negotiated on a case-by-case basis and was assessed to ensure value for money, while giving the UK the best chance of rapidly obtaining and deploying a safe and effective vaccine.”\\nThe UK, like the EU, has paid a considerable amount of money up front to help in the development of a number of vaccines that may or may not work, including AstraZeneca’s, so the final prices for those will be lower. However, it did not support Pfizer/BioNTech nor Moderna, so will be left with a high price tag for those vaccines.\\nThe United States has paid higher prices than Europe. Bernstein Research, an analysis and investment firm, calculated that the EU has a 24% discount on the Pfizer vaccine compared with the United States. Part of the reason may be that Europe helped fund the original research by BioNTech.\\nThe US will pay $4 a dose for the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine under development, compared with the EU price of €1.78, which is 45% cheaper, according to Bernstein.\\nAt the other end of the scale, Moderna’s vaccine, developed in Cambridge, Massachusetts, with $2.5bn of funding and orders from Operation Warp Speed, will cost 20% more on the European market – $18 a dose compared with $15 in the US.\\nDrugs and vaccines have traditionally been more expensive in the US because there is no cost-effectiveness mechanism – as there is in the UK and some other countries – to decide whether they are value for money. The free market operates and drugs are paid for by health insurance schemes.',\n",
       "  \"O\\nf the dozens of places where a coronavirus vaccine might be born, one is DIOSynVax, a small company started by a Canadian pathologist named Jonathan Heeney. In ordinary times, I’d have visited Heeney in his office, in a stately red-brick building in Cambridge. I’d have met his team and his Aria III cytometer, which looks like as if might brew a strong, space-age espresso but which, in fact, uses its four lasers to separate cells marked with fluorescent dyes as they flow through the machine at 10,000 cells per second. I’d have tried to wangle my way into the lab designated containment level 3, the highest-but-one level of biosafety security, where Heeney’s biologists investigate pathogens such as the West Nile virus or the tuberculosis bacterium. These would be so lethal if they escaped that the lab is nearly hermetic. The joints along the walls, floor and ceiling are sealed and re-sealed; the steel panels in the walls, according to government guidelines, have to be “of the type used in the nuclear industry”; a flow of air must constantly be forced in if the door is open, to prevent the germs inside from drifting out. I would have even seen the coronavirus vaccine candidates themselves: samples of clear liquid, held in glass vials.\\n'It’s a razor’s edge we’re walking': inside the race to develop a coronavirus vaccine – podcast\\nRead more\\nBut Heeney couldn’t take the risk. Understandably, he didn’t want anyone carrying Covid-19 into his lab and infecting his staff. “It’s a challenge already, because when they go home to their families every day, you don’t know who they’re passing on the bus or the train,” he said when I first spoke to him last week. At the time, Heeney was considering quarantining himself. A Cambridge college had offered him a room, so that he could shuttle between lab and bed, meeting as few people as possible. “I don’t have time to get sick,” Heeney said. He runs his company out of Cambridge University’s department of veterinary medicine, where he is a professor. He’s just a 12-minute bicycle ride from where I live, but we video-conferenced on Zoom.\\nSince 2016, Heeney has been honing a set of methods – a platform, in vaccine parlance – that can be used to fashion vaccines that destroy whole families of viruses. Last year, he won a Gates Foundation grant of $2m (£1.6m) to fund research into a universal flu vaccine – one that will prevail against every kind of flu virus. “It’s the mother of all challenges, the holy grail,” Heeney said. In January, he kept an eye on a new disease that was flying across eastern China. After two weeks, when Chinese scientists published the coronavirus’s genetic sequence, Heeney told me his team decided: “Let’s do with this what we’re doing with the flu.”\\nDefeating Covid-19 will call for more than vaccines; it will involve quarantines, social distancing, antivirals and other drugs, and healthcare for the sick. But the idea of a vaccine – the quintessential silver bullet – has come to bear an almost unreasonable allure. The coronavirus arrived at a ripe moment in genetic technology, when the advances of the past half-decade have made it possible for vaccine projects to explode off the blocks as soon as a virus is sequenced. These cutting-edge vaccines don’t use weakened forms of the germ to build our immunity, as all vaccines once did; rather, they contain short copies of parts of the germ’s genetic code – its DNA or RNA – which can produce fragments of the germ within our bodies.\\nThus, for the first time ever, scientists have been able to muster up vaccine prospects mere weeks into a new, fast-spreading disease. Right now, there are at least 43 Covid-19 vaccines in development around the world – in Brisbane and Hong Kong, in the US and the UK, in the labs of universities and companies. Most of these are DNA or RNA vaccines. One vaccine, made in 63 days by an American biotech firm named Moderna, moved into human trials on 16 March, entering the bloodstream of the first of 45 healthy adult volunteers in Seattle. It was a “world indoor record”, said Anthony Fauci, the doctor who heads the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. “Nothing has ever gone that fast.”\\nCoronaviruses are named after the corona (crown) of surface proteins (outer dots) that are used to penetrate a host cell. Photograph: Pasieka/Getty/Science Photo Library\\nUntil this century, crafting a vaccine for even a long-familiar pathogen such as the polio virus, ushering it through trials and bringing it to market could take as long as 10 or 20 years. The first of these three stages is now staggeringly quick; a scientist at one company, Inovio Pharmaceuticals, told New Scientist magazine that her team had a preliminary model for a Covid-19 vaccine after just three hours of work.\\nThe thrust of this revolution – the capacity to create an infinitesimal part of an already minute virus, without handling a virus specimen at all – can seem godlike. But the next two stages – testing vaccines in humans and then manufacturing them for wide use – remain mortally slow. This is especially so because these newest types of vaccines – DNA or RNA vaccines – have never yet been licensed for use on humans. Outside a lab, they are completely unproven. With Covid-19, both contagion and vaccine are so new that there’s no telling what human trials will reveal, or how long they will take. Every scientist, policymaker and researcher I spoke to said that we’ll be lucky to have a vaccine for use within 12-18 months.\\nIf a DNA or RNA vaccine against Covid-19 is ever approved, it will be a watershed moment – not just because it will bear out the promise of this technology, but also because the technology will fortify us against future pandemics. Over the past few years, epidemiologists, risk analysts and policymakers have made concerted efforts to sharpen research and rethink the industrial model of vaccine production, all in preparation for the hypothetical disaster they call Disease X: any unknown disease that springs suddenly into our species and races ruinously through it. Covid-19 is the first Disease X to arise since the term was invented, but it won’t be the last. The climate is warming, we’re hacking down forests, our population is expanding and our skills at waging biological warfare are improving. The odds that we’ll keep encountering more and more Disease Xs are increasing. We will need all the vaccines we can make.\\nH\\neeney was spending part of his winter break with friends in Canada when he first read about an outbreak in China. “I’m a scientist,” he said. “I can’t help but follow this kind of news, even on holiday.” Back then, it seemed like a version of flu or pneumonia that might stay in Wuhan. A few days into the new year, though, the disease’s eagerness to travel became evident, and by the time Heeney rejoined his team in Cambridge, the nature of the pathogen had become clear, too. “We thought: ‘OK, this is a coronavirus. It’s going to be a tough one.’”\\nThe first time Heeney encountered coronaviruses was in 1988, as an HIV researcher at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the US. Heeney had initially trained as a vet, so his boss asked him to investigate a flurry of coronavirus cases in an unusual group of patients: a pack of cheetahs. “Some collector out in Oregon was trying to preserve the species by breeding them in a captive colony,” Heeney said. The cheetahs lost weight, their gums swelled and their livers and kidneys struggled to function. They moped about their park, depressed and ill. Later, Heeney found that the feline coronavirus had been passed to the cheetahs by a domestic cat. For the next couple of decades, Heeney remained an HIV scientist. He didn’t work much with animal viruses again until 2007, when he came to Cambridge to study diseases that spilled from animals to humans, and to develop vaccines for them.\\nIn its essence, even the most advanced vaccine functions on the same premise as the earliest mode of immunisation: cotton pads soaked in smallpox pus that were stuffed into the nostrils of healthy children in 16th-century China. The principle of vaccination is still to bluff the body: to slip in weakened germs, or even parts of germs, that do no harm but induce the release of antibodies that grant long-lasting immunity. The inducements have grown more sophisticated, but they continue to rely on the body’s biological defences. Humankind has developed no system of immune response more effective than the one that’s been inside us for hundreds of thousands of years.\\nThe latest class of vaccines – the type that Heeney works on – hold genetic material such as DNA or RNA; these are the kind that have never yet been licensed for use. They can be developed quickly, and they jog our immunity in distinctly different ways from everything that came before. The oldest method of vaccination involves dosing a person with inactive or enfeebled forms of the pathogen. For most of the past century, sourcing these was a laborious affair. For decades, scientists depleted the strength of viruses by growing them in human cell strains kept in labs at low temperatures; once the virus was sufficiently weak, it was safe to be sent into the human body in a vaccine. One line of lung cells, sourced from an aborted foetus in Sweden and multiplied again and again in lab cultures in the US, helped inoculate 300 million people against rubella, rabies, mumps and several other diseases.\\nIn the 1980s, researchers learned to mass-produce sub-units of a virus, each fragment assembled out of proteins and sugars. This might be a toxin or a part of the viral shell – just a signature whiff of the pathogen that can trigger immune reactions when introduced into the body. These molecular fragments are called antigens, because they generate antibodies that target them. Despite this technological advance, all these antigens still had to be cultivated in labs or factories.\\nIt wasn’t until this century that the real leap occurred, propelling scientists towards DNA and RNA vaccines of the kind that Heeney and others develop. Once computers became powerful enough to sequence the genetic code of a pathogen quickly and cheaply, scientists were able to easily create snippets of its genes, which could then be sent into the human body. These snippets, using our own cells as miniature factories, can manufacture their antigens within us. As soon as a germ’s gene sequence is known, scientists can begin concocting a vaccine for it.\\nA scientist in a lab in Rockville, Maryland working on a vaccine for Covid-19. Photograph: Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP via Getty\\nThat’s what happened with Covid-19. On the last day of 2019, Wuhan’s health authorities reported the strange pneumonia variant to the World Health Organization. By mid-January, Chinese scientists had posted online the full, machine-readable genome of the Covid-19 virus: all 29,903 nucleic bases that comprise its sequence of RNA – ribonucleic acid, its genetic material.\\nFor scientists around the world, this was the starter pistol being fired. By studying the published genome, they could single out sets of genes that make specific proteins in the Covid-19 virus: the S-protein making up the spikes on the virus’s outer envelope, for instance, or the phosphorus-laden protein in the walls of an inner capsule, packaging the RNA within.\\nShortly after the coronavirus’s sequence was published, Heeney’s team set to work. The central question in their research is this: what antigens – what portions of the virus – can be found that are similar across a range of coronaviruses? If scientists discover these and, by deploying them in vaccines, drill our immune systems to recognise them, we will have given ourselves a way to fend off several kinds of coronavirus diseases, including Covid-19. The spike proteins jutting out of all these viruses, giving the appearance of a fringed crown, are a prime example of such antigens. Every coronavirus uses its spikes to invade human cells. Once our immune systems engineer antibodies in reaction to a vaccine of spike-protein antigens, they will have not just a method to identify coronaviruses, but also a prospective point of attack to cripple them.\\nThe first thing Heeney’s team did was compare the genetic sequences of the Covid-19 virus and other coronavirus strains, to figure out what structural commonalities they might use as antigens. This approach put me in mind of a captain of some medieval army, who had obtained the plans of the castles he planned to attack and was now studying them to see if they all contained the same weak drawbridges, so that he could order up a single siege engine to knock them all down.\\nWhen, after a few days, they had selected their antigens – the spike protein, but also some others – the biologists in Heeney’s lab looked for their “blueprints”: the genes that direct the virus to construct each of these antigens. These lie in the gene sequences of the coronaviruses: one section of genetic code that holds the information to make a spike protein, another section for a different antigen, and so on. In late January, the lab sent these sections of code electronically to a German company, which built them out into synthetic genes – made artificially, but otherwise consisting of the same sugars and other material as our own DNA.\\nThese minuscule lengths of DNA were sent back to Cambridge suspended in vials of colourless, viscous fluid. In any eventual human trials, this DNA will be injected into the body to do what it’s meant to do: construct antigens to prod the immune system into action. This is all meticulous, elaborate work, but the power of modern computing can hurry it along at astonishing speed. By the first week of February, Heeney said, his scientists were carrying out trials in mice.\\nIn all of this, no one in Heeney’s team handled the coronavirus itself; in fact, until the synthetic DNA arrived from Germany, most of their work was on computers. This would have been unimaginable for earlier generations of vaccine scientists, who took in full-strength pathogens and then, with immense care, whittled down their potency. Heeney longed to know, first-hand, how the virus behaves in cells and what kinds of antibodies respond to it. For weeks, he said, “no one outside China had isolated the virus”. Then, towards the end of January, scientists at the University of Melbourne announced that they’d grown cultures of the virus.\\nBraving the uncertainties of travel, Heeney flew via Thailand to Australia, arriving in time for the first inoculation of a mouse with the cultured virus on 19 February. “I wanted to establish some collaborations with these teams. They’ll be important for us down the line,” Heeney told me. In a bygone time, he might have brought back a vial of virus with him. “When I was a youngster, people would just put samples in their briefcases, or in the breast pockets of their coats. But the biosecurity protocols are intense now, so you can’t do that any more.”\\nUnlike Heeney’s project, which takes on a whole family of viruses, most vaccine projects are targeting just the virus causing Covid-19, but they follow the same basic, still-experimental approach: synthesise DNA or RNA, tuck that genetic material into a vaccine and have it build antigens once it’s shot into the body. (I found only a couple of projects that are working the older way, using a weakened form of the whole virus in a vaccine.) Heeney is fully aware that these DNA and RNA vaccines may all still collapse in trials. “There are graveyards full of failed viral vaccine candidates,” he said. But if even one succeeds, “then we’ll be entering a brave new world of vaccines”.\\nT\\no an outsider, the design of a DNA or RNA vaccine in a lab seems like cool, ordered science, conducted by computers, technicians in sterile oversuits, and machines that hum quietly. The next stage – when the vaccine has to negotiate clinical trials – is rife with all the messy uncertainties of human biology. In other words, while genetic technology has dramatically shrunk the first leg of the process from years to weeks, the second leg remains as long as ever, so that vaccine development now resembles a pair of misshapen trousers.\\nRegulatory trials take months or even years because, for one, they can’t go faster than the rate at which humans metabolise vaccines. But they’re also time-consuming because so much is at stake, and because it’s impossible to predict how our complex physiology will react to a new vaccine. These trials determine if a vaccine is safe, what its dosages should be, how effective it is, and what its side effects are. In the US, 90% of drugs fail to make it past these trials. The overriding purpose of the process is abundant caution; a vaccine that unexpectedly proves harmful is the industry’s worst nightmare.\\nIn the literature, past mishaps flash like red warning signals. In 1942, a yellow fever vaccine contaminated with a hepatitis B virus was given to more than 300,000 American troops; nearly 150 of them died. The field’s classic reference text, Plotkin’s Vaccines, by the physician Stanley Plotkin, refers sombrely to “the Cutter incident” – a 1955 episode in which a manufacturer named Cutter Laboratories failed to properly deactivate the virus in its polio shot. The faulty vaccine caused roughly 40,000 cases of polio, paralysed 260 people and killed 10.\\nThe US’s strict rules to regulate vaccines emerged, in part, because of Cutter Laboratories. The company survived, but paid out millions in civil damages. The Cutter incident set a precedent for more lawsuits during the next three decades, in which parents argued that their children had been disabled by malfunctioning vaccines. Some pharma firms, worried about multimillion-dollar claims settlements, abandoned vaccines altogether; others hiked their prices to cover any future legal costs. To keep vaccines cheap and vaccinations regular, the US government had to set up a compensation fund that eased most of the liability on vaccine companies.\\nIn the midst of a pandemic, so many forces tug at the vaccine development process – politics, industry, science, money, fear, hope – that there’s a perpetual hazard of clinical trials being hurried or of a poorly planned vaccination scheme being rushed out. One historical analogue is found in 1976 – like 2020, an election year. That February, a bout of swine flu broke out in an army post in New Jersey, and one soldier died. In comparison to Covid-19, the outbreak now seems minor, but it jolted President Ford’s government, which was already suffering from the second-hand shame of Nixon’s resignation just two years earlier. The administration fretted that, in the autumn, at the height of flu season, the virus would exact a huge loss of life; one government estimate figured that 1 million Americans would die.\\nSo Ford announced a plan to vaccinate everyone in the country, and had the Centers for Disease Control draft a $136m plan to do it. He ignored Albert Sabin, one of the heroes of the polio vaccine, who advised against immunisation, believing that no epidemic was imminent. Ford also ignored the warnings coming out of clinical trials, in which one of the four manufacturers was found to have formulated some unknown number of its 2.6m doses with a different flu virus altogether. Congress exempted all these companies from liabilities if their vaccine harmed anyone. Beginning in October, 40 million Americans were vaccinated, but by mid-December, it emerged that the shot came with a slightly increased risk of contracting Guillain–Barré syndrome, an immobilising neurological condition.\\nThe vaccine campaign was scrapped soon after; by that time, close to 450 people had been afflicted with Guillain–Barré. It was impossible to say how many of these cases were seeded by the vaccine. And if the vaccine really did prevent a swine flu epidemic, there was no way to know; the counterfactual – no vaccination, a ravaging pandemic – was hidden from view. This vaccine’s legacy, in public memory, was the paralysis of those hundreds of people.\\nAlready, the temptation to accelerate the trials of Covid-19 vaccines is becoming apparent. Earlier this month, Donald Trump suggested using “a solid flu vaccine … on corona”. Not possible, scientists informed him. When he declared that a vaccine would be available within a few months, he had to be told that, in that time, vaccines would only be ready for testing. Ordinarily, human trials come after many phases of animal testing, but at least two companies – one of them Moderna – have decided to do both in parallel. The scientists I spoke to, though, kept telling me that testing couldn’t be rushed. “There will be many trials, and we need to be ready for some failures,” Heeney said. He leaned in towards his webcam as if to push his point physically through the internet to me. “We have to avoid overpromising, because if there’s an accident with one of those first vaccines – if someone gets ill and it gets into the Daily Mail, ‘New vaccine threatens survival’ or some ridiculous headline – then people won’t want to take even the later vaccines that do work. It’s a razor’s edge we’re walking here.”\\nAmong the peculiarities of this pandemic, moreover, is the fact that we, the general populace, might determine how well human trials go. If huge swathes of society become infected before the vaccine is ready to test on humans, the trials will be difficult to conduct, said Sarah Gilbert, an immunologist at the University of Oxford’s Edward Jenner Institute for Vaccine Research. Gilbert’s team also has a vaccine candidate for Covid-19, based on an earlier vaccine it had devised for Middle East respiratory syndrome, or Mers, another coronavirus disease. In mid-March, Gilbert had to put an auto-response on her email. When her team was ready to recruit subjects for vaccine trials, it would be advertised on the website, she wrote. “Please do not contact me about volunteering.”\\nGilbert’s worry is that, at the peak of infection, the virus will be bouncing so frantically around the population that “you can’t screen your volunteers. By the time you get their results back, they may have been exposed.” Organising trials after the peak subsides presents another problem, because so many people will have cultivated a natural immunity by then. Transmission will have dropped as well, Gilbert said – it’s hard to know how well a vaccine trial is going if the subjects aren’t being exposed to the virus at all. “This is herd immunity – good for the population, but it makes testing a vaccine more difficult,” she explained.\\nThe best possible scenario involves delaying the pandemic’s peak – pushing it through the summer towards August, to buy scientists a few extra months to run their trials. “So we’d really be pleased,” Gilbert said sternly, “if everyone will just do what they’re being told and stay at home.”\\nA\\nt some point in March, Heeney’s sense of time started to grow muddled. Things happened so fast, and his weeks were so full, that dates lost their meaning; once, while speaking to me, he had to thumb back through his email to recollect even roughly when a particular step in his research had happened. “The coronavirus dominates our days,” he said. He wakes before dawn to pore through feeds of scientific data and journal articles. “There are conference calls, there’s all this paperwork to fill out so we can deal safely with pathogens, there’s the need to scale up the lab to work on the vaccine. There’s just no routine anymore. It feels like the wild west right now.”\\nLike every other scientist, Heeney spends part of his days worrying about funding. All these vaccine projects hurtling towards trials may yet be drawn to a screeching halt by a lack of money. Trials are expensive; so is the outlay on manufacturing and marketing vaccines. “If you’re going to make enough doses for the whole world, you’re going to need billions and billions of dollars,” Heeney said. Earlier this week, the Wellcome Trust put an exact number on it: a further $3bn, across the industry, to fund and produce enough vaccines to beat the pandemic.\\nMost of this money will go towards trials and production, the costs of which are now frequently borne by drug companies. After the 80s, when a series of mergers left the pharma industry in the hands of a few behemoth companies, vaccines fell thoroughly under the sway of market forces, subject to the kind of logic that prompted Goldman Sachs, in a 2018 report, to wonder: “Is curing patients a sustainable business model?” (It isn’t, the analysts concluded.)\\nDiseases that are borne out of poverty, and that require cheap vaccines, such as cholera, are largely ignored, says Peter Jay Hotez, the dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. So are diseases that are uncommon, or diseases that have come and gone. Taxpayers fund most vaccine research, but the pharma titans that can make them at scale are reluctant to commit to a vaccine if the likelihood of profit is meagre. “We have a broken ecosystem for making vaccines,” Hotez told me.\\nIf the business wasn’t set up this way, Hotez thinks, he’d have a Covid-19 vaccine to offer, based on an earlier project that wilted from lack of funding. The story of Hotez’s vaccine is a parable for this field, and it foretells one highly possible future for all the exciting vaccine work currently underway against Covid-19.\\nWhen Sars broke out in 2002, scientists and companies rolled up their sleeves to deliver a vaccine. But after 2004, no Sars cases were reported, so research flagged; one vaccine, from Sanofi, never made it past clinical trials. Ideally, Hotez says, vaccines would still have been run through the first few steps of trials and kept in reserve for future emergencies. Between 2011 and 2016, Hotez and his team designed a potential vaccine for Sars, and had the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research make 20,000 doses, to test on humans. But none of Hotez’s usual funders gave him a grant for these trials. “Sars dropped off their list of priorities,” Maria Elena Bottazzi, one of Hotez’s collaborators at Baylor, told me. “We had other situations, like Ebola or Zika.” The industry’s attention is easily diverted, Hotez said. “It’s like little kids playing a football game. The ball goes in one direction and all the kids run after it. Then it goes in another direction and all the kids run that way.”\\nSo much about Covid-19 is still unclear that companies can’t yet gauge the profit margins on a vaccine. Will the disease fade before a vaccine is approved? Will DNA or RNA vaccines even work? Will everyone be inoculated – a bumper payday from billions of doses – or will vaccines go to just a few at-risk groups, such as healthcare workers or anyone over 40? “At some point, there will be a go/no-go decision to make for companies,” said Jason Schwartz, a vaccine policy scholar at Yale. “And then they’ll have to figure out if it’s worth the risk.” One way to make it worthwhile is to engage in price gouging, which drug companies have always been happy to do. Earlier this month, the US passed a coronavirus spending bill that deliberately left out controls on vaccine prices.\\nEquipment in a Biocad lab, a Russian biotechnology company, working on a Covid-19 vaccine. Photograph: Biocad Press Office/TASS\\nAt the same time, pharma companies are indispensable, said Charlie Weller, who heads the vaccines programme at the Wellcome Trust. (When Weller spoke to me one evening on the phone, she had to break off for a minute to comfort her little daughter, who’d burst into tears after learning that, as the child of a key worker, she’d have to keep going to school even while her friends stayed home.) Pharma firms pay for most clinical trials, invest in experts and equipment, and bring drugs to market. They assume the right to set prices and decide what vaccines to sell because they claim to bear the most financial risk. “If we have to be ready for more Disease Xs, we need to rethink this whole underlying structure,” Weller told me. “We have to do it so that the risk is shared.”\\nTwo years ago, the Coalition of Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi) was founded to do just this: to allay some of the financial risk of research, and to keep this research going even in the troughs between epidemics. Cepi’s funding – about $740m – comes from a combination of philanthropists and governments. Melanie Saville, its director of vaccine development, told me that they were funding eight ongoing Covid-19 vaccine projects. But Cepi’s own money for Covid-19 was going to run out by the end of March. Without more donations, none of its funded vaccines would progress beyond the first phase of clinical trials.\\nOne of Cepi’s ambitions is to create its own “investigational stockpile” of vaccines – vaccines that have passed the first two out of three stages of clinical trials, and that then bide their time in cold storage. Everyone hopes they will never be required, but if necessary, they can be brought forth, hustled through the final clinical trial stage – which must be conducted in a real outbreak – and launched into production. Saville said Cepi has no storage or clinical facilities of its own, and that the stockpiles would reside individually with manufacturers. This disappointed me; for a second, I’d dreamed of a vaccine storehouse nestled somewhere in the Arctic – a Svalbard against sickness, a vault so titanic that it dwarfed the germs it intended to fight by zillions of orders of magnitude.\\nA\\nweek after I met Heeney on Zoom, I called him again. He gave me a phone number in his Cambridge college; he had decided to self-quarantine himself in a room after all. “It’s not like I’ve been at risk, but if one of us goes down, we all go down like dominoes,” he said. He was full of praise for his team – “all these bright, talented individuals who are still living at home but are otherwise trying to live isolated lives, like monks in a monastery”. When Heeney moved into his room, he wiped down all the surfaces. One day, he went to get a cup of coffee, and when he came back to his room, he saw that two men had come in to change the batteries in the fire alarm. “It was crazy. I thought: ‘Here I am trying to keep the risk factor low. Does this have to happen now?’”\\nHis lab is still running trials in mice. It’s a long process, he said. “You take tissue cultures from the mice and you study them. We’re getting all this data, so that we can see what works and what doesn’t.” It’s too early to tell which of the vaccine projects out there will succeed, he said. “You know, I think it’s pretty amazing that humans have got vaccines in trials already,” Heeney said. “The trials will tell us what we need to know. My worry is that the devil is in the details with this coronavirus. But I hope I’m wrong.

The impending shortage means that no one under 50 in England will get a first dose until 1 May. Only people aged 50 or over, those who are clinically vulnerable, and those awaiting their second dose, will be able to get a vaccination at present.\\nCovid vaccines for England's under-50s delayed due to shortage\\nRead more\\nQ: What does this letter say?\\nA: The government’s vaccines taskforce has told NHS England: “There will be a significant reduction in weekly supply available from manufacturers beginning in the week commencing 29 March, meaning volumes for first doses will be significantly constrained. They now currently predict this will continue for a four-week period, as a result of reductions in national inbound vaccines supply.”\\nQ: What impact will that have on the rollout of the Covid vaccines?\\nA: Vaccination sites will not be administering vaccines to anyone under 50 during all of April. The letter, written by two senior NHS England officials, Emily Lawson and Nikita Kanani, says jabs will only be “permissible in exceptional circumstances”. It adds: “Those aged 49 or younger should not be offered vaccinations unless they are eligible via a higher cohort because they are, for example, clinically vulnerable, or unpaid carers, or frontline health and care workers.”\\nThe change affects the 1,700 or so vaccination sites run by GPs, hospital trusts and pharmacists. Immunisations can only proceed for people in the cohorts labelled one to nine – that is, everyone aged 50 or over or who is in a vulnerable group, as defined by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation.\\nQ: So the under-50s will have to wait for their first dose until May?\\nA: Yes. The letter adds: “From today [17 March] the supply constraint means vaccination centres and community pharmacy-led vaccination services should close unfilled bookings from the week commencing 29 March and ensure no further appointments are uploaded to the national booking system or local booking systems from 1 to 30 April.”\\nQ: Why has this “significant reduction” in supply of the Covid vaccines occurred?\\nA: The letter does not say. It just refers to the “result of reductions in national inbound vaccines supply”. It is understood to involve the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine and not the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. AstraZeneca is thought to have experienced what one NHS official called “manufacturing capacity problems”. One NHS source said: “The letter is unusual. But remember that these are biological products that are being manufactured for the first time and at pace, therefore things could always go wrong.”\\nThere was speculation Wednesday evening that the impending shortfall was caused by delays in delivery of 10m doses of the AstraZeneca doses from India. This product is particularly important because it makes up about 75% of the vaccines so far administered in the UK; the Pfizer vaccine accounts for the remaining 25%. AstraZeneca produce about 2m doses a week but the amounts can vary. Initial deliveries of a third vaccine, made by the American firm Moderna, are due in April.\\nQ: What might this mean for the government’s target of offering a first dose to all over-50s by 15 April and to every adult by the end of July?\\nA: Matt Hancock, the heath secretary, maintained that the 15 April deadline would be honoured and Whitehall officials have said that everyone aged 18 or over will still be offered their first jab before the end of July. “Timescales have not changed,” said an official.\\nBut while the NHS Confederation called Hancock’s pledge over over-50s “reassuring”, it warned that “putting an embargo on new first-dose bookings for a whole month due to supply constraints will make this an even taller order”. It added, in reference to European countries which have stopped using the AstraZeneca vaccine over claims about blood clots: “This is particularly true given that the events in Europe have knocked some patients’ confidence in confirming or attending their scheduled appointments.”\\nThere is also speculation that some GPs could now decide not to take part in the extension of vaccinations to the under-50s, whenever it comes, as they have patients to see at their surgeries who need help with medical problems. Primary care networks have until Sunday to opt in or out of that phase of the deployment.\\nQ: How significant is this interruption to the vaccine programme?\\nA: There have been shortages before. For example, in a letter on 2 March Lawson and Kanani warned vaccination sites that there would “be minimal allocations of new vaccine in the first part of the week commencing 8 March”. That led, for a time, to sites opening for fewer hours or days. In contrast, this week vaccine supplies have been plentiful, allowing more people to have their first or second jab. The slowdown during April will clearly reduce the headline total of vaccinated people that the government has regularly lauded.\\nQ: Will the supply dip affect the roadmap for reopening the economy?\\nA: A key criterion for unlocking, set out by the prime minister, included continued successful vaccine deployment. Given the expectation that most vulnerable groups will largely have been vaccinated by 12 April, when pubs can serve outdoors and shops can reopen, it seems likely that the roadmap dates will not alter unless there are other significant challenges.\\nThis article was amended on 18 March 2021. The date of an earlier Lawson-Kanani letter alerting vaccination sites to possible shortages was corrected to 2 March (replacing 3 April).\",\n",
       "  \"Plans to prioritise hard-hit south Auckland in New Zealand’s vaccination rollout have been welcomed by experts – though cricketers hoping to head for the UK will have to wait for clarity.\\nCovid-19 response minister Chris Hipkins said on Wednesday that vaccinations over the next three to four months would go to the two million New Zealanders who were “most at risk of getting or spreading Covid-19, or getting seriously sick from it”.\\nHipkins said this “targeted” approach was designed to minimise the risk of future coronavirus outbreaks, as well as protecting the elderly and other at-risk groups.\\nDon't blame one suburb for New Zealand's Covid problems – Manukau is central to the fight, and we will win\\nRead more\\nSouth Auckland has been at the centre of two outbreaks in recent months, the latest of which led to a week-long lockdown in the city.\\nResidents of the area aged over 65 or those with underlying health conditions would begin being vaccinated from the end of March. Many of the 18,000 border force workers and their families who have already had their first dose are also based in south Auckland.\\nIn comments to the Science Media Centre, Dr Collin Tukuitonga of the University of Auckland’s faculty of medical and health sciences, said it was “fantastic” that South Auckland had been recognised as a priority.\\n“We’ve been lobbying for this to happen for some weeks now. While we do this because we recognise the risk for the communities in south Auckland, they are also adjacent to the airport, so there is a risk of an outbreak to everyone else in the country too – so prioritising south Auckland residents with these conditions and ages will be good for everyone.”\\nTukuitonga said the decision to vaccinate only those at risk in South Auckland, instead of the whole population, was a “pragmatic response to limited vaccine supply”. He said allocating 40,000 courses to Māori and Pacific providers was “fantastic”.\\n“I know from experience that Pacific medical providers have predominantly Pacific patients, so it will improve the chances of the vaccine being delivered to those people that often have difficulty accessing health services.”\\nNew Zealanders in residential care facilities would start to get their vaccinations later this month, before of all New Zealanders aged 65 or over from May.\\nAuckland emerges from strict weeklong Covid lockdown\\nRead more\\nTwo special categories were still being considered by the government, said Hipkins: one for people who may need to get the vaccine on compassionate grounds, and one recognising “national significance” category, which could include diplomats, athletes or others seeking to represent New Zealand overseas.\\n“But I want to be clear here: these will be quite small groups of people. It’s not going to be a backdoor way for people to push themselves up the queue.”\\nHipkins declined to comment on whether New Zealand’s cricket team could be made a priority following confirmation by Stuff that Cricket New Zealand made inquiries about bumping the Black Caps up the queue ahead of the World Test Championship.\\nThe team are due to be leave New Zealand in May ahead of games in England and India, two global hotspots for the virus. Hipkins said a decision would be announced in the next fortnight.\\nHipkins said that the order of 8.5m doses of the Pfizer vaccine announced on Monday had enabled the government to vaccinate the entire population, though he warned that the dates and sequencing of the rollout could change with vaccine supply.\\nSo far 265,000 doses had been received, including a fourth shipment on Tuesday.\\nEvery New Zealander should be able to get a free vaccine after July, Hipkins said, though those logistics were to be determined. “Our plan is to have as many people as possible vaccinated by the end of the year…\\n“Getting vaccinated is the best way to protect whānau, their lives and their livelihoods. The biggest factor in lifting Covid-19 restrictions will be timely and high uptake of vaccines.”\\nThe plan follows a survey by global company Ipsos on Wednesday suggested that only 51% of New Zealanders said they were likely to get the jab; 18% said it was likely and 24% were unsure. That latter group said they were concerned about vaccines moving through clinical trials too quickly, and the potential side effects.\\nIpsos New Zealand public affairs research director, Amanda Dudding, told Radio New Zealand that just making the vaccine available for all New Zealanders would not be enough – the government would need to reassure people that it was safe and effective.\\nA public health campaign is due in the coming months.\",\n",
       "  'The emergence of vaccines against Covid-19 has been hailed as gamechanger by experts, but polls have revealed the speed of their development and approval is a matter of concern for some people. We take a look at how and why such processes were so rapid.\\nHow long does it normally take to develop a vaccine from scratch?\\nTraditionally it is a slow process. Speaking at the joint Commons and Lords national security strategy committee in October, Sir Patrick Vallance said that before Covid, it took an average of about 10 years to develop a completely new vaccine, with the process never before achieved in less than about five years.\\nHow has it been possible to develop vaccines against Covid-19 in less than a year?\\nA key consideration is funding – public and private cash has been poured into the race for a Covid vaccine, pushing aside the usual financial concerns facing pharmaceutical companies. What’s more, demand and urgency are high.\\n“The fact that governments pre-bought the vaccines meant that people could take greater risks with what they did at an earlier stage without having to take one step at a time,” said Stephen Evans, professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.\\nTraditionally, vaccines are developed by weakening it or killing a virus, or by producing part of the virus in the lab. However this is time consuming.\\nInstead, both the Oxford University/AstraZeneca and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines were developed using different “platform technologies” that involve slotting genetic material from the virus into a tried and tested delivery package. Once introduced into the human body this genetic material is used by the protein-making machinery in our cells to churn out the coronavirus “spike protein”, triggering an immune response.\\nThis approach was aided by the speed at which scientists in China identified and shared the genetic sequence of the new coronavirus, and work that was already under way on other coronaviruses.\\nBut while such platform technologies are a non-traditional approach, that does not mean they are untested.\\n“The mRNA vaccine platform technology [which the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine uses] has been in development for over two decades,” said Dr Zoltán Kis, of Imperial College London.\\nThe use of platform technologies not only means a vaccine can be rapidly developed, and that more is known about its safety profile from the start, but production is faster and cheaper as existing production processes can be used.\\nAnother consideration is that while in traditional vaccine development the phases of clinical trials are carried out in sequence, in the case of the Covid vaccines they have overlapped, making the process faster.\\n“Vaccine manufacturing has also been carried out in parallel with the clinical trials, hoping that trials will succeed,” said Kis.\\nEvans added that the large trial sizes and duration was reassuring. “I have seen no corners that have been cut,” he said.\\nFinally, advances in tech have streamlined data-recording, while the advent of social media has made it easier to recruit trial participants – something aided by a strong public desire to help.\\n“It normally takes weeks or months to recruit to a study. This one, it kind of happened overnight,” said Prof Adam Finn, a vaccine expert at the University of Bristol and an investigator on the Oxford/AstraZeneca trials.\\nWhat about approval?\\nDr Penny Ward, visiting professor in pharmaceutical medicine at King’s College London and chair of the education and standards committee of the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Medicine said it typically took about six to nine months for new medicines to be approved. But that is in part because the necessary data is often delivered to regulatory agencies in one go.\\nIn the case of the Covid-19 vaccines, the process has been accelerated by what is known as a “rolling review”, with information released to the regulators as it was acquired.\\n“Rolling review is a very new thing to be done,” said Evans, noting that companies normally wait to make an application until all data is in because the approval process is expensive and risky for them.\\nBut Ward added the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine had only been given a type of emergency approval by the MHRA, meaning approval will be on a batch-by-batch basis until enough information has been received by the MHRA to assure them there is minimal variability between batches of the vaccine.\\nHow has the UK managed to approve vaccines before Europe and the US?\\nWhile there has been much talk about how Brexit might have aided the speedy approval of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine by the MHRA, experts have stressed EU laws allow member states to approve medicines for emergency use without authorisation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA).\\nHowever Evans said the Brexit transition period might mean the MHRA currently had some extra capacity.\\nUK trial to mix and match Covid vaccines to try to improve potency\\nRead more\\n“We are in this slightly weird position where we haven’t had to do the work that we will have to do from 1 January, and we haven’t got the work we’d normally be doing for the EMA,” he said .\\nBut Ward said other factors were important. “In order for [a] product to be approved [by the EMA], the [EU] member states have to agree the conditions of its use,” she said, noting that it took more discussion than if only one state was involved. Another possibility is that Europe may wish to wait to until it is known that there is little variation from batch to batch of vaccine.\\nSimilar considerations could be at play in the US. “The US [Food and Drug Administration] traditionally will not accept or license a product, even in an emergency situation, unless the manufacturing process is fully validated,” said Ward, adding logistical considerations around distribution might also play a role.\\n“The other thing is that the US decided some time ago that they were [not going to] approve a vaccine without a meeting of the advisory committee on vaccines and biologic products,” she said. “That meeting has been schedule for the 10 December for the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine and the Moderna vaccine is being looked at [on] the 17 December.”',\n",

       "  \"The battle against Covid-19 took a major step forward on Friday as the US moved closer to distributing its first one-shot Covid-19 vaccine, after an independent expert advisory panel recommended drug regulators authorize the Johnson & Johnson vaccine for emergency use.\\nThe authorization would be a significant boost to the Biden administration’s vaccination plans, making Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine the third available to the public. Janssen, Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine subsidiary, told a congressional hearing this week that it expects to deliver 20m doses by March and a total of 100m doses before the end of June.\\nThe Johnson & Johnson vaccine, along with those from Pfizer and Moderna, should provide the US with more than enough supply to vaccinate every vaccine-eligible person.\\n“We’re still in the midst of this deadly pandemic,” said Dr Archana Chatterjee, a voting member of the panel and an infectious disease pediatrician at Chicago Medical School, as she explained her vote in favor of recommending the vaccine. “There is a shortage of vaccines that are currently authorized, and I think authorization of this vaccine will help meet the needs at the moment.”\\nWhile regulators at the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) do not always take the advice of their advisory panels, the agency is expected to authorize the vaccine for emergency use.\\n“We urgently need more vaccines [authorized] to protect the millions of Americans who remain at risk” of Covid-19 infection, said Dr Greg Poland, the editor-in-chief of the medical journal Vaccine and leader of the Vaccine Research Group at the Mayo Clinic.\\n“Today, we have seen clear and compelling evidence that the Janssen vaccine candidate is well tolerated, has an acceptable safety profile and most importantly is highly efficacious against Covid-19,” he said. “To me, it is clear that the known benefits vastly outweigh the known risks.”\\nThe recommendation comes soon after the US marks 500,000 deaths from Covid-19, a toll that comes as cases decline in the US and across many countries worldwide. More than 28 million Americans have been infected by Covid-19.\\n“We are seeing positive trends in terms of declining cases,” said Dr Adam MacNeil, a member of the Covid-19 epidemiology taskforce with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. He later added: “We are certainly not out of the woods yet.”\\nImportantly, Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine would also be the easiest to distribute. Unlike vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna, which require sub-zero storage, Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine can be stored at common refrigerator temperatures for up to three months. When frozen it has a shelf life of three years.\\nUS vaccine distribution: track your state's progress\\nRead more\\nThe convenience of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine comes with caveats. The company’s clinical trials were the first to show the potential impacts of Covid-19 variants, or evolutionary changes in the virus.\\nThe vaccine was found to 85% effective at preventing severe disease and to provide complete protection against Covid-19-related hospitalization and death after 28 days. Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine was found to be 72% effective in clinical trials in the US, but only 57% effective in South Africa, where a variant called B1351 originated.\\nHowever, vaccination remains a powerful weapon, even with threats posed by variants. “Even with decreased effectiveness, vaccination may still provide partial protection against variants,” said MacNeil.\\nLike the Moderna vaccine, Johnson & Johnson’s product will only be available to people 18 and older. Pfizer’s vaccine is available to teenagers older than 16. Also, as with other vaccines, researchers are uncertain how long the vaccine protects against Covid-19, and whether it reduces asymptomatic transmission of the virus, although studies are promising.\\nJohnson & Johnson’s vaccine uses different technology from the two vaccines currently available in the US. The new vaccine uses “viral vector” technology, which introduces the body to the genetic code for the spike protein covering the outside of the coronavirus. This code is transmitted by a second, weakened virus called an adenovirus.\\nImmunity is provoked when the body’s immune system then recognizes the coronavirus by this key structure. Vaccines developed by Pfizer and Moderna also prompt the body to recognize spike proteins on the outside of the coronavirus, but deliver the genetic code through lipid nanoparticles, or tiny molecules of fatty acids.\\nBecause scientists are still researching the degree to which any of the authorized vaccines prevent people from spreading Covid-19 to other people, public health authorities recommend people continue to social distance and wear masks after being vaccinated. In theory, a vaccinated person could still spread the SARS-CoV-2 virus, even if they do not experience any symptoms of the disease Covid-19.\\nJohnson & Johnson’s vaccines and the doses already scheduled to be delivered by Moderna and Pfizer, the makers of the two vaccines currently authorized in the US, mean there could be enough supply to vaccinate 400 million people by July. Roughly 267 million people in the US are eligible for a vaccine.\\nThis ease of storage and one-dose regime is likely to increase pressure on the US government to pledge doses to low- and middle-income countries, which often lack the cold chain infrastructure needed to distribute the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines. Currently, dozens of low- and middle-income countries do not expect to begin broadly distributing vaccine doses until 2022.\\nActivists, many of whom also worked to expand access to Aids medications, have described this as “vaccine apartheid”, and a threat to the “project of global population immunity”.\",\n",

       "  \"T\\nhe stakes could hardly be higher; the prize still tantalisingly out of reach. It is no exaggeration to say that the fate of many millions of people rests on the discovery of a vaccine for Covid-19 – the only sure escape route from the pandemic.\\nYet the optimism that accompanied the launch of Oxford University’s human trials this week has to be put in context, and the hurdles facing the scientists need to be understood.\\nThe vaccine hunters are trying to outwit an invisible enemy so small that a million viral particles could fit inside a human cell, but whose biological ingenuity has brought everyday life to a standstill.\\nSo what is the path to success?\\nHow vaccines train our immune system\\nTraditional vaccines work by creating a weakened version of a virus, similar enough to the original that the immune system will be forearmed if the person is exposed to a full infection in future, helping prevent actual illness.\\nThe approach has led to some of our best vaccines, but is also fundamentally risky because there is always a chance that a newly developed attenuated virus won’t be as innocuous as hoped. Clinical trials have to be approached cautiously and slowly – especially when there are no effective treatments for a disease.\\nA slow approach is not ideal in a pandemic.\\nSo it’s perhaps unsurprising that only two of the 76 vaccine candidates that the World Health Organization has on its radar have opted for this traditional approach.\\nThe rest rely on the fast-track idea that the immune system doesn’t need to see the entire virus to generate the ammunition to fight it off in the future. If the virus is the warship, the theory is that the immune system needs only to see the enemy flag to form an indelible immune memory. In the case of Covid-19, this flag takes the form of prominent protrusions, known as spike proteins, that form a halo or “corona” around the virus.\\nAdvances in genetic engineering have given full flight to scientists’ creativity in developing this defence.\\nTeams around the world have moved at unprecedented pace, going from having the genetic sequence for the spike protein in January to vaccine candidates a matter of weeks later.\\nBut many of these technologies are unproven and the success of any trial is far from guaranteed, as this week’s disappointing results for the drug remdesivir show. Ethical questions need to be navigated to ensure the safety of volunteers.\\nAnd then, potentially the most contentious question of all: if a vaccine is found, who gets it first?\\nScientist Xinhua Yan works in the lab at Moderna in Cambridge, MA. Photograph: Boston Globe/Boston Globe via Getty Images\\nThe frontrunners\\nFirst into clinical trials, just eight weeks after the genetic sequence for Covid-19 was published in January, was the US biotech company Moderna, with its RNA vaccine.\\nRNA is a single-stranded messenger molecule that normally delivers genetic instructions from DNA, coiled up inside the nuclei of cells, to the cell’s protein-making factories outside the nucleus.\\nIn this case, the RNA instructs the muscle cells to start churning out the harmless spike protein as a warning to the immune system. Imperial College London’s team, this week backed by £22.5m government funding, is also developing an RNA vaccine, but in a form that hasn’t been tested before in people.\\n“Some groups have skipped animal studies because their technology has been used in human studies,” said Prof Robin Shattock, who is leading the Imperial team. “We don’t have that luxury. It’s probably cost us one or two months, but it’s much better to be cautious and be sure you’ve got something that’s really safe.”\\nAlso testing their candidates in human trials are the Chinese vaccine company CanSino Biologics, and a team at Oxford University led by Prof Sarah Gilbert.\\nBoth are using harmless viruses that have been disabled so that they don’t replicate once they get inside cells. These delivery vehicles are known as “non-replicating viral vectors”.\\nThese teams had already tried and tested the approach for other diseases, such as Ebola, and had flasks of their vectors sitting in freezers, ready to go.\\nA third approach is that of the US biotech company Inovio, a firm that has existed for four decades without developing an approved product, but whose stock soared after it started its trial earlier this month.\\nIts vaccine uses DNA to carry instructions for making the spike protein into cells, which gets transcribed into messenger RNA, which then orders the protein factories to start pumping out the enemy spike protein.\\nThis might seem an unnecessarily elaborate cascade, but some think that getting the enemy flag inside cells and not just into the bloodstream could be important .\\n“Clearly it is true that there are no approved RNA or DNA vaccines on the market today,” said Joseph Kim, Inovio’s CEO. “But I think it’s just a matter of time.”\\nFinally, a fourth strategy simply manufactures massive supplies of the spike protein itself, and injects a dose directly into people.\\nThis is what the big pharma team-up of Sanofi and GSK are betting on. Sanofi is repurposing a vaccine candidate that was developed for Sars in the early 2000s, while GSK is providing an ingredient, known as an adjuvant, that boosts the immune response, which has also been tried and tested.\\nIt’s too early to say which option looks the most promising, according to Richard Hatchett, chief executive officer of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi), which is funding the development and testing of eight candidates.\\n“Some vaccines are going to be very fast to clinic, others have tremendous potential to scale up,” he said. “And the challenge that we face is that there’s going to be a great deal of urgency and pressure to roll out vaccines quickly for obvious reasons. You’re talking about giving a medical product to someone who is well.”\\nWhat are the odds they’ll work?\\nA few candidates will be filtered out in toxicology testing in animals. Others might fail because phase one trials in people produce unexpected side effects.\\nThere is a chance none of them will work.\\nFor some illnesses, including other circulating coronaviruses, the immune system wages its battle, then a few months later forgets it ever happened. Others, like chicken pox or mumps, trigger lifelong immunity.\\nThe truth is we’re not yet sure where on this spectrum Covid-19 lies.\\n“Reasonable guesses are that there might be partial protection for close to a year,” according to Marcus Lipsitch, a professor of epidemiology at Harvard, whose team recently predicted that, in the absence of a vaccine, social distancing may need to continue until 2022. “On the long end, it might be several years of good protection. It’s really speculative at this point.”\\nOn the positive side, Covid-19 appears quite stable genetically, meaning that the spike protein that vaccines are built around should still look the same next winter.\\nThis isn’t the case for flu, which shuffles its genes around so rapidly that new vaccines are needed each year.\\nThere are also questions around the type of immunity required.\\nThe body overcomes illness through antibodies, which see off the virus itself, and killer T-cells, which eliminate cells already infected by the foreign invader. For some illnesses, antibodies do the heavy lifting, but the balance varies depending on pathogen and even across people.\\n“An ideal vaccine should generate a response in both arms of the immune system - antibodies and T cells,” said Kim. He predicts this could be a weakness of RNA and protein vaccines, which are delivered outside of cells, meaning that killer T-cells are not likely to be recruited.\\nThere is also a chance that some trials could grind to a halt, simply because the pandemic has been so well controlled by lockdowns and other measures. “You need a certain hit rate in the population you’re vaccinating to get the statistics to show your vaccine is having protective ability,” said Miles Carroll, head of research at Public Health England’s National Infection Service at Porton Down.\\nBoris Johnson visits a laboratory at the Public Health England National Infection Service in early March. Photograph: Henry Nicholls/Reuters\\nThe possibility of “challenge trials”, in which people are deliberately infected, have been considered, but there are obvious ethical issues with exposing volunteers to a potentially deadly disease.\\n“There’s a lot of interest in this … because it would really accelerate vaccine development, but there are some major hurdles to ensure the safety of the volunteers in that setting,” said Prof Andrew Pollard, chief investigator on the Oxford study.\\nScaling-up\\nVaccine manufacturers talk in terms of yield: how many doses of vaccine do you get out per litre of culture. And there could be significant differences in the ability of teams to produce the number of doses required to make a difference.\\nShattock believes this will be a strength of Imperial’s RNA vaccine candidate, which has the unique feature of replicating itself thousands of times once inside the body.\\n“We can make the equivalent of a million doses within a litre of material,” said Shattock. “Many other vaccines would need hundreds or thousands of litres for that. It’s the scalability. Towards the end of the year we’ll be hoping to make tens of millions of doses.”\\n“If our vaccine were shown to be successful, if everything goes well – and that’s still a big if – we could deploy it in the UK this winter,” said Shattock. “All these smaller approaches will hold the fort until a larger global solution comes.”\\nBy September there could be a vaccine – maybe several – that appear broadly safe and effective.\\nThat’s not enough to get a vaccine licensed, but governments are already talking about the potential for rolling out such candidates to high-risk groups, potentially including millions of health workers, under “emergency use” rules in the absence of this ultimate seal of approval.\\nShare your story\\nShare your stories\\nIf you have been affected or have any information, we'd like to hear from you.

And there have been vaccine calamities in the past – recently the GSK vaccine Pandemrix, given to millions during the swine flu pandemic of 2009, which was linked to narcolepsy in one in every 55,000 jabs.\\nThe principle of transparent informed consent will be critical, Douglas added. “In this case, that would include the fact that if you’re being offered a vaccine in October that didn’t exist in April, there will not yet be long-term safety follow-up experience, although we do have longer term experience with several similar vaccines.”\\nIndividuals could be faced with tough choices – take an experimental vaccine or leave themselves at risk of infection.\\nGlobal solution\\nA woman in Tokyo wearing a mask to help stop the spread of the coronavirus. Photograph: Eugene Hoshiko/AP\\nAt the moment, many teams are trying all sorts of ways to develop a vaccine, but there is no coherent solution for the whole planet. Some are banking on big pharma swooping in with a blockbuster product. Sanofi and GSK, as a joint force, are unique in having the ability to manufacture hundreds of millions of doses without relying on external support.\\nBut multinationals are not built for speed and their reputations depend on absolute safety, so there is no prospect of this team making its vaccine widely available before mid to late-2021.\\nOthers urge a unified approach; governments, the UN, the World Bank and the WHO need to agree a way forward before a lead candidate emerges.\\nNational governments are already making advance purchase agreements and looking to secure their own supply chains.\\n“If vaccine nationalism asserts itself, you could end up having a limitation of a vaccine to one specific population,” said Hatchett. “It’s an understandable response of a leader who is elected by a particular population to protect that population. [But] you can’t protect your people and your economy until the global pandemic is brought under control. We really can’t deal with this one country at a time.”\\nHatchett and others are arguing for a global commitment of tens of billions of dollars to ensure that any successful vaccine is distributed globally and according to need. “In global health terms that’s a very big number,” he said. “But if your point of reference is the global impact that this pandemic is having on the economy, then that’s a very small number. If you buy into the idea that the vaccine is the escape route from the pandemic then that’s a really good investment.”\\nThis article was amended on 28 April 2020 to clarify that RNA delivers genetic instructions from DNA within the cell, rather than outside the cell as originally suggested in “The frontrunners” section.\",\n",
       "  'Matt Hancock has said there will be a significant dip in vaccine supply in April, confirming supplies have been hit by a need to retest 1.7m doses and a delay in arrival of imports from India.\\nSpeaking in the House of Commons, Hancock stressed the overall target timetable for vaccinations would not change but said he wanted to give more information, following the “speculation we’ve seen overnight”, after he was criticised for a press conference on Wednesday where the drop in supply went unexplained.\\n“In the last week, we’ve had a batch of 1.7m doses delayed because of the need to retest its stability,” he said. “Events like this are to be expected in a manufacturing endeavour of this complexity and this shows the rigour of our safety checks. And we have a delay in the scheduled arrival from the Serum Institute of India.”\\nHowever, speaking to the Guardian earlier, a source authorised to speak for the institute denied there was any delay in delivering vaccines, claiming there had been no agreed timeframe to deliver a second tranche of 5m doses.\\nThe source said there had not been a hold-up from the Indian government, and that it had given approval for exports, though permission depended on the situation in India, which has significantly changed in the past fortnight.\\nGovernment sources also declined to clarify which vaccine batch had been affected by the need to retest supplies for stability.\\nThe health secretary said that there would inevitably be some uncertainty in the manufacturing process. “The pace of rollout has always been determined by the availability of supply. The process of manufacturing vaccines is complicated, and subject to unpredictability,” he said.\\n“We make public commitments to the goals we can reach, according to our best estimates of future supply. That supply goes up and down.”\\nHancock said the UK was currently experiencing “some bumper weeks of supply” but that would fall. The slowing of first doses would also come from the need to use the supply to administer second doses to meet the 12-week deadline, Hancock said.\\n“We have a huge number of second doses to deliver during April. Around 12 million people, including many colleagues in this house, will receive their second dose. These second doses cannot be delayed, as they have to be delivered within 12 weeks of the first dose.”\\nHancock was at pains to praise the Serum Institute of India, as well as vaccine producers Pfizer and AstraZeneca, saying the institute was doing “incredible work” producing vaccines for the whole world.\\n“Their technology, and their capability, which has been approved by the MHRA, is remarkable. It truly is a partnership that we can be proud of,” he told MPs.\\nHe said no appointments would be cancelled and that the targets were still on track to be met. “There will be no weeks in April with no first doses, there will be no cancelled appointments as a result of supply issues. Second doses will go ahead as planned.”\\nHancock also announced that Gibraltar had become “the first nation in the world to complete its entire adult vaccination programme”, calling it a “success thanks to a team spirit across the British family of nations”.\\n\\nAfter a slow start, India’s vaccination programme has more than doubled the number of doses it is administering each day compared with last week, which in turn is likely to have increased its demands on the institute’s supply.\\n\\nIndian frontline workers wait to get inoculated with the Covid-19 coronavirus vaccine at a government hospital in Chennai. Photograph: Arun Sankar/AFP/Getty Images\\nIndia has sold or gifted about 59m vaccine doses abroad, compared with the 37m it has administered at home, with another 38m distributed to state governments and awaiting use. Indians have largely backed their government’s programme of “vaccine maitri” (vaccine friendship), but the country’sforeign minister, S Jaishankar, told parliament on Wednesday that exports and donations were “based on the assessment of adequate availability at home”.\\nAstraZeneca has partnered with the institute, which is the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer, to supply the Indian government and other countries, including low- and middle-income ones.\\nA member of the UK government’s joint committee on vaccination and immunisation conceded on Thursday morning that Covid infections could rise as a result of the delay in people in their 40s and younger getting their vaccinations.\\nAdam Finn, who advises UK health departments on immunisation and is a professor of paediatrics at the University of Bristol, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that vaccination of those aged under 50 “may kick off slightly later than we’d optimistically hoped”.\\nFinn said the decline in hospital admissions should continue as long as all those over-50s and vulnerable people were vaccinated on time. He said the 12 weeks between first and second doses must “not be allowed to slip significantly”.',\n",
       "  \"The UK coronavirus vaccine rollout is constrained by limited supply of the vaccines, but the government is on track to vaccinate the top four priority groups by 15 February, Matt Hancock has said.\\nThe health secretary’s comments came amid reports of GP surgeries in some areas having to pause inoculations because supplies were being diverted to areas that still have higher risk groups.\\n“Supply of the vaccine is the rate-limiting factor and we have to make sure that the vaccine is distributed to everybody, in the first instance over the age of 80 and then over the age of 70, by 15 February, so we’re on track,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.\\nAsked whether the problem was that there was not the vaccine to give to those GPs, he replied: “Correct. As I’ve said all the way along in this vaccine programme, the rate-limiting step on the rollout is the supply of the vaccine itself. We are now managing to get that supply more than we have done before, and it will increase over the next few weeks.\\nHe added: “We have enough in the supply chain coming through to be able to deliver against that target.”\\nHancock told ITV’s Good Morning Britain (GMB): “If I had more supply we would go faster. So the constraint is supply, but that’s not the supply coming slower than the schedule. It’s coming on schedule and then we get it out the door.\\n“The good news is we are managing to get it out into arms as quickly as the two companies are delivering to us.”\\nAbout 2.3 million people had already received the vaccine, he said.\\nThe next few days were critical in judging if the national lockdown was working, Hancock said. With people typically being hospitalised two weeks after infection, any levelling off in the coming days would indicate it was.\\nHe also said he hoped the UK had hit the peak of this wave, but it was not certain.\\nHe also gave no indications about when current lockdown restrictions might end. It was “impossible to know” and they would last as “long as they are necessary”, he told Sky News.\\nOn concerns over whether the 12-week delay between the first and second vaccinations could affect efficacy, Hancock said it was an important question and the government had looked into it in “great detail”. “It’s only because you get that protection two to three weeks after your first jab that we can make this decision,” he said.\\n“We know from the trials that from around 12 days after the first jab you start to get that protection and the protection from catching the disease is 89% after the first two weeks, and that compares to 95% once you have the two jabs. But crucially, the protection against having serious disease, being hospitalised or dying is even higher than that.” It was an “absolute slam dunk in terms of saving lives,” he told GMB.\\nTeachers, police officers and shop workers had a good case for being next in line for vaccinations after elderly people, the most vulnerable and health workers, Hancock agreed, but a final decision had not yet been made.\\nShare your story\\nShare your stories\\nIf you have been affected or have any information, we'd like to hear from you.

       "  'New Zealand’s South Island has recorded its first Covid cases in a major city in over a year, with two cases detected in Christchurch, as the government announced it will begin relaxing its strict international border settings.\\nCovid-19 response minister Chris Hipkins said at this stage there would be no snap lockdown for the city, the largest in the South Island, despite the fact one of the cases may have been infectious in the community for almost two weeks.\\n“This is a good reminder to people around the country that cases can pop up and this highlights the importance to get vaccinated,” Hipkins said.\\nBoth of Thursday’s new cases were members of the same household, and one had recently returned from Auckland.\\nNew Zealand announced 89 new cases of Covid-19 on Thursday, including the two in Christchurch. According to the Ministry of Health, 89% of eligible adults in Canterbury, of which Christchurch is the main city, had had at least one dose of the vaccine, and 67% had had both doses. The region would require almost 111,000 people to get both doses before hitting the 90% target set by the government, where most restrictions can be lifted. Across the country, 85% of the eligible population (those aged 12 and over) have had at least one dose of the vaccine, or 72% of the full population; 70% of the eligible population have had both doses, or 60% of the full population.\\nA catamaran and a plan: desperate to get home, New Zealanders set sail across the Tasman\\nRead more\\nEpidemiologist and public health prof Michael Baker said there needed to be stronger protections at the boundaries of the North and South Islands. “We may be seeding the whole South Island with cases right at the moment, because we’ve got increasing transmission in Auckland, and still people flying from Auckland all around the country – and we’ve got limited controls on that,” he said. Baker called for pre-departure testing, and for vaccine requirements on domestic flights.\\nDr Apisalome Talemaitoga, chair of the Pasifika GP network, said via the Science Media Centre, “I just find it unbelievable that we are allowing unvaccinated people out of Auckland to travel – for whatever reason. People should be doubly vaccinated before they can do this.”\\nWith the region still weeks away from 90% vaccination, Baker said there were “huge health and economic reasons for delaying widespread transmission in the South Island as long as possible”. Otherwise, he said, the region could end up facing restrictions or possible lockdowns until Christmas.\\nHipkins said that the two infected people were co-operating with authorities but had not been scanning in using New Zealand’s location tracing app – a detail which may make contact tracing more difficult. Both are unvaccinated.\\nGiving a later update, the minister said that quarantine requirements for international arrivals would be eased next month.\\n“As vaccination rates have increased internationally, the number of Covid cases being picked up through our MIQ [managed isolation and quarantine] facilities has continued to decline. We now only get 2-3 cases per 1,000 arrivals and only around 1 in 2,000 is detected after seven days of isolation,” Hipkins said.\\nFrom 14 November, MIQ stays will be reduced from 14 days to seven, with travellers being tested on days zero, three and six. They will then isolate at home for short periods of around three days, and be tested again on day nine.\\nThis will likely free up about 1,500 rooms a month in MIQ, Hipkins said. Some of this will be taken up by community cases but some will go into the booking system for travellers from overseas.\\nOn 8 November, travellers from low-risk countries, starting with some Pacific islands, will be allowed to bypass MIQ altogether. Travellers will need to be fully vaccinated, unless they are New Zealand citizens.\\nIn the first quarter of 2022, increasing numbers of fully vaccinated international travellers will be able to skip quarantine and self-isolate. This step in the new MIQ regime will be dependent upon the country transitioning to its new traffic light system.\\nNew Zealand Covid: Māori party likens new ‘traffic light’ system to ‘Squid Game’\\nRead more\\nHipkins said: “My message to all New Zealanders, whether they’re here or abroad is a very, very simple one. Get vaccinated. Then we can all get back to doing the things that we love and to seeing the people that we love.”\\nBut New Zealanders stranded overseas and desperate to get home are feeling dissatisfied with the announcement.\\nRikki Sands, a New Zealand citizen based in Brisbane, has entered the MIQ lottery 4 times without success. Sands, who is a specialised mechanical and hydraulic engineer, his wife and two daughters have been planning to come home since the beginning of the year.\\n“I’ve got more chance of winning lotto than an MIQ spot at the moment,” Sands said.\\nHe said the freeing up of 1,500 more MIQ spots was negligible, and did not give him any confidence he would get home sooner.\\nAnd he believes the justifications are unfair. “They said that the reason they can’t open the borders is because the local people aren’t getting vaccinated. But some of the ones that are coming in internationally are all going to be double vaccinated.\\n“Our family is all double-vaxxed and coming from Brisbane, Australia, which is a very low risk area, and we will be getting whatever tests are required before we fly. We just want to get home to our whānau [family].”',\n",

Stop Mandatory Vaccination has more than 150,000 approved members. Vitamin C Against Vaccine Damage claims that large doses of the vitamin can “heal” people from vaccine damage, even though vaccines are safe.\\nHealth experts are calling on Facebook to do more to counter these echo chambers. Dr Wendy Sue Swanson, spokeswoman of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said: “Facebook should prioritise dealing with the threat to human health when falsehoods and misinformation are shared. This isn’t just self-harm, it’s community harm.”\\nSwanson recently met with Facebook strategists and raised her concerns. “Parents deserve the truth. If they are being served up something that is not true it will likely increase their levels of anxiety and fear and potentially change their uptake of vaccines, which is dangerous,” she said.\\nFiona O’Leary, an autism activist and campaigner against pseudo-science, called on Facebook to block anti-vaccine groups. “If they won’t shut down closed groups I’d like to see a Facebook watchdog that will remove misinformation causing harm to children,” she said.\\nThe threat posed by the Facebook groups was put in stark relief by the World Health Organization (WHO), which lists “vaccine hesitancy” – reluctance to vaccinate – as one of the top 10 global health threats in 2019. The WHO points to a 30% worldwide increase in measles, a highly contagious illness that can cause deafness, brain inflammation, pneumonia and death, especially in children.\\nLast month Washington state imposed a state of emergency after 48 people contracted measles. Most of those infected were unvaccinated and under 10 years old.\\nDr Noni MacDonald, a professor of pediatrics at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, who has worked as an expert adviser to the WHO on immunization, questioned why Facebook was unrestrained by the stringent controls against misinformation put on drug companies. “We don’t let big pharma or big food or big radio companies do this, so why should we let this happen in this venue?”\\nShe added: “When a drug company puts a drug up in the formal media, they can’t tell you something false or they will be sued. So why is this different? Why is this allowed?”\\nAs concern grows about measles outbreaks in the US, the spotlight is increasingly falling on the closed anti-vaccination Facebook groups.

They will also find recommendations for alternative remedies that are falsely claimed to protect against disease.\\nGironda is listed on LinkedIn as CEO of an online business in Colorado selling high-dose vitamin C. Members of her closed group are encouraged to “shop now” – in one click they are linked directly to her firm, Revitalize Wellness.\\nThe site sells vitamin C powder in bulk, with customers encouraged to give children aged two up to three grams a day whereas the recommended daily intake is 15mg. Twenty-four-pound bags of the powder cost $432.\\nRevitalize Wellness carries a disclaimer saying that its products are “not intended to treat, diagnose, cure or prevent disease”. But in conversation with members of her closed Facebook group, Gironda gives the opposite advice.\\n“Vitamin C has an amazing record of fighting the same diseases vaccines were made for,” she posts.\\nIn another entry she says: “I think the cons outweigh the pros on vaccines … Through greed they became a weapon. Until they become safe and not driven by money I would avoid all vaccines.”\\nGironda is also listed as an administrator of a separate Facebook group called Vitamin C Against Vaccine Damage. She welcomes new approved members to the group with this statement: “Science and experience of mass amounts of people have proven that vaccines CAN damage the body … Vitamin C is the safest and most effective way to protect from damage for those that are mandated to be vaccinated.”\\nAfter the Guardian contacted Gironda, the status of the group Vitamin C Against Vaccine Damage was changed from closed to secret.

Measles susceptibility skyrockets among people with low vitamin A.”\\nIn December a mother in Canada wrote to one of the groups, describing herself as a “first time mom with a 6 month old daughter who is completely vax free. My daughter is sick, I’m so upset and worried. I have always felt confident in my decision to not vax but I’m worried about what she may have contacted [sic].”\\nA fellow member wrote back: “Baby needs a vitamin C IV.”\\nDavid Robert Grimes, a physicist who specializes in countering fake science, said vitamin C would “absolutely not” protect against measles. “Vitamin C does nothing for immunization.”\\nGrimes said that he had repeatedly reported anti-vaccination groups to Facebook, with no result. “Facebook has a moral responsibility to do something – this misinformation has the potential to kill children.”\\nThe Guardian put it to Gironda that misinformation about vaccines can put children’s lives at risk and that vitamin C was not an effective alternative. In an email she said: “Revitalize Wellness maintains a neutral stance on vaccines. We make every effort to uphold that neutral stance in our Facebook group.”\\nShe said that she was a follower of “vitamin C pioneers”, citing Dr Linus Pauling, Dr Frederick Klenner, Dr Robert F Cathcart, Dr Irwin Stone and Dr Thomas Levy.

       "  'New Zealand’s South Island has recorded its first Covid cases in a major city in over a year, with two cases detected in Christchurch, as the government announced it will begin relaxing its strict international border settings.\\nCovid-19 response minister Chris Hipkins said at this stage there would be no snap lockdown for the city, the largest in the South Island, despite the fact one of the cases may have been infectious in the community for almost two weeks.\\n“This is a good reminder to people around the country that cases can pop up and this highlights the importance to get vaccinated,” Hipkins said.\\nBoth of Thursday’s new cases were members of the same household, and one had recently returned from Auckland.\\nNew Zealand announced 89 new cases of Covid-19 on Thursday, including the two in Christchurch. According to the Ministry of Health, 89% of eligible adults in Canterbury, of which Christchurch is the main city, had had at least one dose of the vaccine, and 67% had had both doses. The region would require almost 111,000 people to get both doses before hitting the 90% target set by the government, where most restrictions can be lifted. Across the country, 85% of the eligible population (those aged 12 and over) have had at least one dose of the vaccine, or 72% of the full population; 70% of the eligible population have had both doses, or 60% of the full population.\\nA catamaran and a plan: desperate to get home, New Zealanders set sail across the Tasman\\nRead more\\nEpidemiologist and public health prof Michael Baker said there needed to be stronger protections at the boundaries of the North and South Islands. “We may be seeding the whole South Island with cases right at the moment, because we’ve got increasing transmission in Auckland, and still people flying from Auckland all around the country – and we’ve got limited controls on that,” he said. Baker called for pre-departure testing, and for vaccine requirements on domestic flights.\\nDr Apisalome Talemaitoga, chair of the Pasifika GP network, said via the Science Media Centre, “I just find it unbelievable that we are allowing unvaccinated people out of Auckland to travel – for whatever reason. People should be doubly vaccinated before they can do this.”\\nWith the region still weeks away from 90% vaccination, Baker said there were “huge health and economic reasons for delaying widespread transmission in the South Island as long as possible”. Otherwise, he said, the region could end up facing restrictions or possible lockdowns until Christmas.\\nHipkins said that the two infected people were co-operating with authorities but had not been scanning in using New Zealand’s location tracing app – a detail which may make contact tracing more difficult. Both are unvaccinated.\\nGiving a later update, the minister said that quarantine requirements for international arrivals would be eased next month.\\n“As vaccination rates have increased internationally, the number of Covid cases being picked up through our MIQ [managed isolation and quarantine] facilities has continued to decline. We now only get 2-3 cases per 1,000 arrivals and only around 1 in 2,000 is detected after seven days of isolation,” Hipkins said.\\nFrom 14 November, MIQ stays will be reduced from 14 days to seven, with travellers being tested on days zero, three and six. They will then isolate at home for short periods of around three days, and be tested again on day nine.\\nThis will likely free up about 1,500 rooms a month in MIQ, Hipkins said. Some of this will be taken up by community cases but some will go into the booking system for travellers from overseas.\\nOn 8 November, travellers from low-risk countries, starting with some Pacific islands, will be allowed to bypass MIQ altogether. Travellers will need to be fully vaccinated, unless they are New Zealand citizens.\\nIn the first quarter of 2022, increasing numbers of fully vaccinated international travellers will be able to skip quarantine and self-isolate. This step in the new MIQ regime will be dependent upon the country transitioning to its new traffic light system.\\nNew Zealand Covid: Māori party likens new ‘traffic light’ system to ‘Squid Game’\\nRead more\\nHipkins said: “My message to all New Zealanders, whether they’re here or abroad is a very, very simple one. Get vaccinated. Then we can all get back to doing the things that we love and to seeing the people that we love.”\\nBut New Zealanders stranded overseas and desperate to get home are feeling dissatisfied with the announcement.\\nRikki Sands, a New Zealand citizen based in Brisbane, has entered the MIQ lottery 4 times without success. Sands, who is a specialised mechanical and hydraulic engineer, his wife and two daughters have been planning to come home since the beginning of the year.\\n“I’ve got more chance of winning lotto than an MIQ spot at the moment,” Sands said.\\nHe said the freeing up of 1,500 more MIQ spots was negligible, and did not give him any confidence he would get home sooner.\\nAnd he believes the justifications are unfair. “They said that the reason they can’t open the borders is because the local people aren’t getting vaccinated. But some of the ones that are coming in internationally are all going to be double vaccinated.\\n“Our family is all double-vaxxed and coming from Brisbane, Australia, which is a very low risk area, and we will be getting whatever tests are required before we fly. We just want to get home to our whānau [family].”',\n",

By barring access to others, they are able to serve undiluted misinformation without challenge.\\nThe groups are large and sophisticated. Stop Mandatory Vaccination has more than 150,000 approved members. Vitamin C Against Vaccine Damage claims that large doses of the vitamin can “heal” people from vaccine damage, even though vaccines are safe.\\nHealth experts are calling on Facebook to do more to counter these echo chambers. Dr Wendy Sue Swanson, spokeswoman of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said: “Facebook should prioritise dealing with the threat to human health when falsehoods and misinformation are shared. This isn’t just self-harm, it’s community harm.”\\nSwanson recently met with Facebook strategists and raised her concerns. “Parents deserve the truth. If they are being served up something that is not true it will likely increase their levels of anxiety and fear and potentially change their uptake of vaccines, which is dangerous,” she said.\\nFiona O’Leary, an autism activist and campaigner against pseudo-science, called on Facebook to block anti-vaccine groups. “If they won’t shut down closed groups I’d like to see a Facebook watchdog that will remove misinformation causing harm to children,” she said.\\nThe threat posed by the Facebook groups was put in stark relief by the World Health Organization (WHO), which lists “vaccine hesitancy” – reluctance to vaccinate – as one of the top 10 global health threats in 2019. The WHO points to a 30% worldwide increase in measles, a highly contagious illness that can cause deafness, brain inflammation, pneumonia and death, especially in children.\\nLast month Washington state imposed a state of emergency after 48 people contracted measles. Most of those infected were unvaccinated and under 10 years old.\\nDr Noni MacDonald, a professor of pediatrics at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, who has worked as an expert adviser to the WHO on immunization, questioned why Facebook was unrestrained by the stringent controls against misinformation put on drug companies. “We don’t let big pharma or big food or big radio companies do this, so why should we let this happen in this venue?”\\nShe added: “When a drug company puts a drug up in the formal media, they can’t tell you something false or they will be sued. So why is this different? Why is this allowed?”\\nAs concern grows about measles outbreaks in the US, the spotlight is increasingly falling on the closed anti-vaccination Facebook groups.

They will also find recommendations for alternative remedies that are falsely claimed to protect against disease.\\nGironda is listed on LinkedIn as CEO of an online business in Colorado selling high-dose vitamin C. Members of her closed group are encouraged to “shop now” – in one click they are linked directly to her firm, Revitalize Wellness.\\nThe site sells vitamin C powder in bulk, with customers encouraged to give children aged two up to three grams a day whereas the recommended daily intake is 15mg. Twenty-four-pound bags of the powder cost $432.\\nRevitalize Wellness carries a disclaimer saying that its products are “not intended to treat, diagnose, cure or prevent disease”. But in conversation with members of her closed Facebook group, Gironda gives the opposite advice.\\n“Vitamin C has an amazing record of fighting the same diseases vaccines were made for,” she posts.\\nIn another entry she says: “I think the cons outweigh the pros on vaccines … Through greed they became a weapon.

She welcomes new approved members to the group with this statement: “Science and experience of mass amounts of people have proven that vaccines CAN damage the body … Vitamin C is the safest and most effective way to protect from damage for those that are mandated to be vaccinated.”\\nAfter the Guardian contacted Gironda, the status of the group Vitamin C Against Vaccine Damage was changed from closed to secret.

Both are unvaccinated.\\nGiving a later update, the minister said that quarantine requirements for international arrivals would be eased next month.\\n“As vaccination rates have increased internationally, the number of Covid cases being picked up through our MIQ [managed isolation and quarantine] facilities has continued to decline. We now only get 2-3 cases per 1,000 arrivals and only around 1 in 2,000 is detected after seven days of isolation,” Hipkins said.\\nFrom 14 November, MIQ stays will be reduced from 14 days to seven, with travellers being tested on days zero, three and six. They will then isolate at home for short periods of around three days, and be tested again on day nine.\\nThis will likely free up about 1,500 rooms a month in MIQ, Hipkins said. Some of this will be taken up by community cases but some will go into the booking system for travellers from overseas.\\nOn 8 November, travellers from low-risk countries, starting with some Pacific islands, will be allowed to bypass MIQ altogether. Travellers will need to be fully vaccinated, unless they are New Zealand citizens.\\nIn the first quarter of 2022, increasing numbers of fully vaccinated international travellers will be able to skip quarantine and self-isolate. This step in the new MIQ regime will be dependent upon the country transitioning to its new traffic light system.\\nNew Zealand Covid: Māori party likens new ‘traffic light’ system to ‘Squid Game’\\nRead more\\nHipkins said: “My message to all New Zealanders, whether they’re here or abroad is a very, very simple one.

The WHO points to a 30% worldwide increase in measles, a highly contagious illness that can cause deafness, brain inflammation, pneumonia and death, especially in children.\\nLast month Washington state imposed a state of emergency after 48 people contracted measles. Most of those infected were unvaccinated and under 10 years old.\\nDr Noni MacDonald, a professor of pediatrics at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, who has worked as an expert adviser to the WHO on immunization, questioned why Facebook was unrestrained by the stringent controls against misinformation put on drug companies. “We don’t let big pharma or big food or big radio companies do this, so why should we let this happen in this venue?”\\nShe added: “When a drug company puts a drug up in the formal media, they can’t tell you something false or they will be sued.

       "  'New Zealand’s South Island has recorded its first Covid cases in a major city in over a year, with two cases detected in Christchurch, as the government announced it will begin relaxing its strict international border settings.\\nCovid-19 response minister Chris Hipkins said at this stage there would be no snap lockdown for the city, the largest in the South Island, despite the fact one of the cases may have been infectious in the community for almost two weeks.\\n“This is a good reminder to people around the country that cases can pop up and this highlights the importance to get vaccinated,” Hipkins said.\\nBoth of Thursday’s new cases were members of the same household, and one had recently returned from Auckland.\\nNew Zealand announced 89 new cases of Covid-19 on Thursday, including the two in Christchurch. According to the Ministry of Health, 89% of eligible adults in Canterbury, of which Christchurch is the main city, had had at least one dose of the vaccine, and 67% had had both doses. The region would require almost 111,000 people to get both doses before hitting the 90% target set by the government, where most restrictions can be lifted. Across the country, 85% of the eligible population (those aged 12 and over) have had at least one dose of the vaccine, or 72% of the full population; 70% of the eligible population have had both doses, or 60% of the full population.\\nA catamaran and a plan: desperate to get home, New Zealanders set sail across the Tasman\\nRead more\\nEpidemiologist and public health prof Michael Baker said there needed to be stronger protections at the boundaries of the North and South Islands. “We may be seeding the whole South Island with cases right at the moment, because we’ve got increasing transmission in Auckland, and still people flying from Auckland all around the country – and we’ve got limited controls on that,” he said. Baker called for pre-departure testing, and for vaccine requirements on domestic flights.\\nDr Apisalome Talemaitoga, chair of the Pasifika GP network, said via the Science Media Centre, “I just find it unbelievable that we are allowing unvaccinated people out of Auckland to travel – for whatever reason. People should be doubly vaccinated before they can do this.”\\nWith the region still weeks away from 90% vaccination, Baker said there were “huge health and economic reasons for delaying widespread transmission in the South Island as long as possible”. Otherwise, he said, the region could end up facing restrictions or possible lockdowns until Christmas.\\nHipkins said that the two infected people were co-operating with authorities but had not been scanning in using New Zealand’s location tracing app – a detail which may make contact tracing more difficult. Both are unvaccinated.\\nGiving a later update, the minister said that quarantine requirements for international arrivals would be eased next month.\\n“As vaccination rates have increased internationally, the number of Covid cases being picked up through our MIQ [managed isolation and quarantine] facilities has continued to decline. We now only get 2-3 cases per 1,000 arrivals and only around 1 in 2,000 is detected after seven days of isolation,” Hipkins said.\\nFrom 14 November, MIQ stays will be reduced from 14 days to seven, with travellers being tested on days zero, three and six. They will then isolate at home for short periods of around three days, and be tested again on day nine.\\nThis will likely free up about 1,500 rooms a month in MIQ, Hipkins said. Some of this will be taken up by community cases but some will go into the booking system for travellers from overseas.\\nOn 8 November, travellers from low-risk countries, starting with some Pacific islands, will be allowed to bypass MIQ altogether. Travellers will need to be fully vaccinated, unless they are New Zealand citizens.\\nIn the first quarter of 2022, increasing numbers of fully vaccinated international travellers will be able to skip quarantine and self-isolate. This step in the new MIQ regime will be dependent upon the country transitioning to its new traffic light system.\\nNew Zealand Covid: Māori party likens new ‘traffic light’ system to ‘Squid Game’\\nRead more\\nHipkins said: “My message to all New Zealanders, whether they’re here or abroad is a very, very simple one. Get vaccinated. Then we can all get back to doing the things that we love and to seeing the people that we love.”\\nBut New Zealanders stranded overseas and desperate to get home are feeling dissatisfied with the announcement.\\nRikki Sands, a New Zealand citizen based in Brisbane, has entered the MIQ lottery 4 times without success. Sands, who is a specialised mechanical and hydraulic engineer, his wife and two daughters have been planning to come home since the beginning of the year.\\n“I’ve got more chance of winning lotto than an MIQ spot at the moment,” Sands said.\\nHe said the freeing up of 1,500 more MIQ spots was negligible, and did not give him any confidence he would get home sooner.\\nAnd he believes the justifications are unfair. “They said that the reason they can’t open the borders is because the local people aren’t getting vaccinated. But some of the ones that are coming in internationally are all going to be double vaccinated.\\n“Our family is all double-vaxxed and coming from Brisbane, Australia, which is a very low risk area, and we will be getting whatever tests are required before we fly.

       "  'New Zealand’s South Island has recorded its first Covid cases in a major city in over a year, with two cases detected in Christchurch, as the government announced it will begin relaxing its strict international border settings.\\nCovid-19 response minister Chris Hipkins said at this stage there would be no snap lockdown for the city, the largest in the South Island, despite the fact one of the cases may have been infectious in the community for almost two weeks.\\n“This is a good reminder to people around the country that cases can pop up and this highlights the importance to get vaccinated,” Hipkins said.\\nBoth of Thursday’s new cases were members of the same household, and one had recently returned from Auckland.\\nNew Zealand announced 89 new cases of Covid-19 on Thursday, including the two in Christchurch. According to the Ministry of Health, 89% of eligible adults in Canterbury, of which Christchurch is the main city, had had at least one dose of the vaccine, and 67% had had both doses. The region would require almost 111,000 people to get both doses before hitting the 90% target set by the government, where most restrictions can be lifted. Across the country, 85% of the eligible population (those aged 12 and over) have had at least one dose of the vaccine, or 72% of the full population; 70% of the eligible population have had both doses, or 60% of the full population.\\nA catamaran and a plan: desperate to get home, New Zealanders set sail across the Tasman\\nRead more\\nEpidemiologist and public health prof Michael Baker said there needed to be stronger protections at the boundaries of the North and South Islands. “We may be seeding the whole South Island with cases right at the moment, because we’ve got increasing transmission in Auckland, and still people flying from Auckland all around the country – and we’ve got limited controls on that,” he said. Baker called for pre-departure testing, and for vaccine requirements on domestic flights.\\nDr Apisalome Talemaitoga, chair of the Pasifika GP network, said via the Science Media Centre, “I just find it unbelievable that we are allowing unvaccinated people out of Auckland to travel – for whatever reason. People should be doubly vaccinated before they can do this.”\\nWith the region still weeks away from 90% vaccination, Baker said there were “huge health and economic reasons for delaying widespread transmission in the South Island as long as possible”. Otherwise, he said, the region could end up facing restrictions or possible lockdowns until Christmas.\\nHipkins said that the two infected people were co-operating with authorities but had not been scanning in using New Zealand’s location tracing app – a detail which may make contact tracing more difficult. Both are unvaccinated.\\nGiving a later update, the minister said that quarantine requirements for international arrivals would be eased next month.\\n“As vaccination rates have increased internationally, the number of Covid cases being picked up through our MIQ [managed isolation and quarantine] facilities has continued to decline. We now only get 2-3 cases per 1,000 arrivals and only around 1 in 2,000 is detected after seven days of isolation,” Hipkins said.\\nFrom 14 November, MIQ stays will be reduced from 14 days to seven, with travellers being tested on days zero, three and six. They will then isolate at home for short periods of around three days, and be tested again on day nine.\\nThis will likely free up about 1,500 rooms a month in MIQ, Hipkins said. Some of this will be taken up by community cases but some will go into the booking system for travellers from overseas.\\nOn 8 November, travellers from low-risk countries, starting with some Pacific islands, will be allowed to bypass MIQ altogether. Travellers will need to be fully vaccinated, unless they are New Zealand citizens.\\nIn the first quarter of 2022, increasing numbers of fully vaccinated international travellers will be able to skip quarantine and self-isolate. This step in the new MIQ regime will be dependent upon the country transitioning to its new traffic light system.\\nNew Zealand Covid: Māori party likens new ‘traffic light’ system to ‘Squid Game’\\nRead more\\nHipkins said: “My message to all New Zealanders, whether they’re here or abroad is a very, very simple one. Get vaccinated. Then we can all get back to doing the things that we love and to seeing the people that we love.”\\nBut New Zealanders stranded overseas and desperate to get home are feeling dissatisfied with the announcement.\\nRikki Sands, a New Zealand citizen based in Brisbane, has entered the MIQ lottery 4 times without success. Sands, who is a specialised mechanical and hydraulic engineer, his wife and two daughters have been planning to come home since the beginning of the year.\\n“I’ve got more chance of winning lotto than an MIQ spot at the moment,” Sands said.\\nHe said the freeing up of 1,500 more MIQ spots was negligible, and did not give him any confidence he would get home sooner.\\nAnd he believes the justifications are unfair. “They said that the reason they can’t open the borders is because the local people aren’t getting vaccinated. But some of the ones that are coming in internationally are all going to be double vaccinated.\\n“Our family is all double-vaxxed and coming from Brisbane, Australia, which is a very low risk area, and we will be getting whatever tests are required before we fly. We just want to get home to our whānau [family].”',\n",

Stop Mandatory Vaccination has more than 150,000 approved members. Vitamin C Against Vaccine Damage claims that large doses of the vitamin can “heal” people from vaccine damage, even though vaccines are safe.\\nHealth experts are calling on Facebook to do more to counter these echo chambers. Dr Wendy Sue Swanson, spokeswoman of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said: “Facebook should prioritise dealing with the threat to human health when falsehoods and misinformation are shared. This isn’t just self-harm, it’s community harm.”\\nSwanson recently met with Facebook strategists and raised her concerns. “Parents deserve the truth. If they are being served up something that is not true it will likely increase their levels of anxiety and fear and potentially change their uptake of vaccines, which is dangerous,” she said.\\nFiona O’Leary, an autism activist and campaigner against pseudo-science, called on Facebook to block anti-vaccine groups. “If they won’t shut down closed groups I’d like to see a Facebook watchdog that will remove misinformation causing harm to children,” she said.\\nThe threat posed by the Facebook groups was put in stark relief by the World Health Organization (WHO), which lists “vaccine hesitancy” – reluctance to vaccinate – as one of the top 10 global health threats in 2019. The WHO points to a 30% worldwide increase in measles, a highly contagious illness that can cause deafness, brain inflammation, pneumonia and death, especially in children.\\nLast month Washington state imposed a state of emergency after 48 people contracted measles. Most of those infected were unvaccinated and under 10 years old.\\nDr Noni MacDonald, a professor of pediatrics at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, who has worked as an expert adviser to the WHO on immunization, questioned why Facebook was unrestrained by the stringent controls against misinformation put on drug companies. “We don’t let big pharma or big food or big radio companies do this, so why should we let this happen in this venue?”\\nShe added: “When a drug company puts a drug up in the formal media, they can’t tell you something false or they will be sued. So why is this different? Why is this allowed?”\\nAs concern grows about measles outbreaks in the US, the spotlight is increasingly falling on the closed anti-vaccination Facebook groups.

Twenty-four-pound bags of the powder cost $432.\\nRevitalize Wellness carries a disclaimer saying that its products are “not intended to treat, diagnose, cure or prevent disease”.

Otherwise, he said, the region could end up facing restrictions or possible lockdowns until Christmas.\\nHipkins said that the two infected people were co-operating with authorities but had not been scanning in using New Zealand’s location tracing app – a detail which may make contact tracing more difficult. Both are unvaccinated.\\nGiving a later update, the minister said that quarantine requirements for international arrivals would be eased next month.\\n“As vaccination rates have increased internationally, the number of Covid cases being picked up through our MIQ [managed isolation and quarantine] facilities has continued to decline. We now only get 2-3 cases per 1,000 arrivals and only around 1 in 2,000 is detected after seven days of isolation,” Hipkins said.\\nFrom 14 November, MIQ stays will be reduced from 14 days to seven, with travellers being tested on days zero, three and six. They will then isolate at home for short periods of around three days, and be tested again on day nine.\\nThis will likely free up about 1,500 rooms a month in MIQ, Hipkins said. Some of this will be taken up by community cases but some will go into the booking system for travellers from overseas.\\nOn 8 November, travellers from low-risk countries, starting with some Pacific islands, will be allowed to bypass MIQ altogether. Travellers will need to be fully vaccinated, unless they are New Zealand citizens.\\nIn the first quarter of 2022, increasing numbers of fully vaccinated international travellers will be able to skip quarantine and self-isolate. This step in the new MIQ regime will be dependent upon the country transitioning to its new traffic light system.\\nNew Zealand Covid: Māori party likens new ‘traffic light’ system to ‘Squid Game’\\nRead more\\nHipkins said: “My message to all New Zealanders, whether they’re here or abroad is a very, very simple one.

But some of the ones that are coming in internationally are all going to be double vaccinated.\\n“Our family is all double-vaxxed and coming from Brisbane, Australia, which is a very low risk area, and we will be getting whatever tests are required before we fly.

The WHO points to a 30% worldwide increase in measles, a highly contagious illness that can cause deafness, brain inflammation, pneumonia and death, especially in children.\\nLast month Washington state imposed a state of emergency after 48 people contracted measles. Most of those infected were unvaccinated and under 10 years old.\\nDr Noni MacDonald, a professor of pediatrics at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, who has worked as an expert adviser to the WHO on immunization, questioned why Facebook was unrestrained by the stringent controls against misinformation put on drug companies. “We don’t let big pharma or big food or big radio companies do this, so why should we let this happen in this venue?”\\nShe added: “When a drug company puts a drug up in the formal media, they can’t tell you something false or they will be sued.

Until they become safe and not driven by money I would avoid all vaccines.”\\nGironda is also listed as an administrator of a separate Facebook group called Vitamin C Against Vaccine Damage. She welcomes new approved members to the group with this statement: “Science and experience of mass amounts of people have proven that vaccines CAN damage the body … Vitamin C is the safest and most effective way to protect from damage for those that are mandated to be vaccinated.”\\nAfter the Guardian contacted Gironda, the status of the group Vitamin C Against Vaccine Damage was changed from closed to secret.

       "  'New Zealand’s South Island has recorded its first Covid cases in a major city in over a year, with two cases detected in Christchurch, as the government announced it will begin relaxing its strict international border settings.\\nCovid-19 response minister Chris Hipkins said at this stage there would be no snap lockdown for the city, the largest in the South Island, despite the fact one of the cases may have been infectious in the community for almost two weeks.\\n“This is a good reminder to people around the country that cases can pop up and this highlights the importance to get vaccinated,” Hipkins said.\\nBoth of Thursday’s new cases were members of the same household, and one had recently returned from Auckland.\\nNew Zealand announced 89 new cases of Covid-19 on Thursday, including the two in Christchurch. According to the Ministry of Health, 89% of eligible adults in Canterbury, of which Christchurch is the main city, had had at least one dose of the vaccine, and 67% had had both doses. The region would require almost 111,000 people to get both doses before hitting the 90% target set by the government, where most restrictions can be lifted. Across the country, 85% of the eligible population (those aged 12 and over) have had at least one dose of the vaccine, or 72% of the full population; 70% of the eligible population have had both doses, or 60% of the full population.\\nA catamaran and a plan: desperate to get home, New Zealanders set sail across the Tasman\\nRead more\\nEpidemiologist and public health prof Michael Baker said there needed to be stronger protections at the boundaries of the North and South Islands. “We may be seeding the whole South Island with cases right at the moment, because we’ve got increasing transmission in Auckland, and still people flying from Auckland all around the country – and we’ve got limited controls on that,” he said. Baker called for pre-departure testing, and for vaccine requirements on domestic flights.\\nDr Apisalome Talemaitoga, chair of the Pasifika GP network, said via the Science Media Centre, “I just find it unbelievable that we are allowing unvaccinated people out of Auckland to travel – for whatever reason. People should be doubly vaccinated before they can do this.”\\nWith the region still weeks away from 90% vaccination, Baker said there were “huge health and economic reasons for delaying widespread transmission in the South Island as long as possible”. Otherwise, he said, the region could end up facing restrictions or possible lockdowns until Christmas.\\nHipkins said that the two infected people were co-operating with authorities but had not been scanning in using New Zealand’s location tracing app – a detail which may make contact tracing more difficult. Both are unvaccinated.\\nGiving a later update, the minister said that quarantine requirements for international arrivals would be eased next month.\\n“As vaccination rates have increased internationally, the number of Covid cases being picked up through our MIQ [managed isolation and quarantine] facilities has continued to decline. We now only get 2-3 cases per 1,000 arrivals and only around 1 in 2,000 is detected after seven days of isolation,” Hipkins said.\\nFrom 14 November, MIQ stays will be reduced from 14 days to seven, with travellers being tested on days zero, three and six. They will then isolate at home for short periods of around three days, and be tested again on day nine.\\nThis will likely free up about 1,500 rooms a month in MIQ, Hipkins said. Some of this will be taken up by community cases but some will go into the booking system for travellers from overseas.\\nOn 8 November, travellers from low-risk countries, starting with some Pacific islands, will be allowed to bypass MIQ altogether. Travellers will need to be fully vaccinated, unless they are New Zealand citizens.\\nIn the first quarter of 2022, increasing numbers of fully vaccinated international travellers will be able to skip quarantine and self-isolate. This step in the new MIQ regime will be dependent upon the country transitioning to its new traffic light system.\\nNew Zealand Covid: Māori party likens new ‘traffic light’ system to ‘Squid Game’\\nRead more\\nHipkins said: “My message to all New Zealanders, whether they’re here or abroad is a very, very simple one. Get vaccinated. Then we can all get back to doing the things that we love and to seeing the people that we love.”\\nBut New Zealanders stranded overseas and desperate to get home are feeling dissatisfied with the announcement.\\nRikki Sands, a New Zealand citizen based in Brisbane, has entered the MIQ lottery 4 times without success. Sands, who is a specialised mechanical and hydraulic engineer, his wife and two daughters have been planning to come home since the beginning of the year.\\n“I’ve got more chance of winning lotto than an MIQ spot at the moment,” Sands said.\\nHe said the freeing up of 1,500 more MIQ spots was negligible, and did not give him any confidence he would get home sooner.\\nAnd he believes the justifications are unfair. “They said that the reason they can’t open the borders is because the local people aren’t getting vaccinated. But some of the ones that are coming in internationally are all going to be double vaccinated.\\n“Our family is all double-vaxxed and coming from Brisbane, Australia, which is a very low risk area, and we will be getting whatever tests are required before we fly.

       "  'New Zealand’s South Island has recorded its first Covid cases in a major city in over a year, with two cases detected in Christchurch, as the government announced it will begin relaxing its strict international border settings.\\nCovid-19 response minister Chris Hipkins said at this stage there would be no snap lockdown for the city, the largest in the South Island, despite the fact one of the cases may have been infectious in the community for almost two weeks.\\n“This is a good reminder to people around the country that cases can pop up and this highlights the importance to get vaccinated,” Hipkins said.\\nBoth of Thursday’s new cases were members of the same household, and one had recently returned from Auckland.\\nNew Zealand announced 89 new cases of Covid-19 on Thursday, including the two in Christchurch. According to the Ministry of Health, 89% of eligible adults in Canterbury, of which Christchurch is the main city, had had at least one dose of the vaccine, and 67% had had both doses. The region would require almost 111,000 people to get both doses before hitting the 90% target set by the government, where most restrictions can be lifted. Across the country, 85% of the eligible population (those aged 12 and over) have had at least one dose of the vaccine, or 72% of the full population; 70% of the eligible population have had both doses, or 60% of the full population.\\nA catamaran and a plan: desperate to get home, New Zealanders set sail across the Tasman\\nRead more\\nEpidemiologist and public health prof Michael Baker said there needed to be stronger protections at the boundaries of the North and South Islands. “We may be seeding the whole South Island with cases right at the moment, because we’ve got increasing transmission in Auckland, and still people flying from Auckland all around the country – and we’ve got limited controls on that,” he said. Baker called for pre-departure testing, and for vaccine requirements on domestic flights.\\nDr Apisalome Talemaitoga, chair of the Pasifika GP network, said via the Science Media Centre, “I just find it unbelievable that we are allowing unvaccinated people out of Auckland to travel – for whatever reason. People should be doubly vaccinated before they can do this.”\\nWith the region still weeks away from 90% vaccination, Baker said there were “huge health and economic reasons for delaying widespread transmission in the South Island as long as possible”. Otherwise, he said, the region could end up facing restrictions or possible lockdowns until Christmas.\\nHipkins said that the two infected people were co-operating with authorities but had not been scanning in using New Zealand’s location tracing app – a detail which may make contact tracing more difficult. Both are unvaccinated.\\nGiving a later update, the minister said that quarantine requirements for international arrivals would be eased next month.\\n“As vaccination rates have increased internationally, the number of Covid cases being picked up through our MIQ [managed isolation and quarantine] facilities has continued to decline. We now only get 2-3 cases per 1,000 arrivals and only around 1 in 2,000 is detected after seven days of isolation,” Hipkins said.\\nFrom 14 November, MIQ stays will be reduced from 14 days to seven, with travellers being tested on days zero, three and six. They will then isolate at home for short periods of around three days, and be tested again on day nine.\\nThis will likely free up about 1,500 rooms a month in MIQ, Hipkins said. Some of this will be taken up by community cases but some will go into the booking system for travellers from overseas.\\nOn 8 November, travellers from low-risk countries, starting with some Pacific islands, will be allowed to bypass MIQ altogether. Travellers will need to be fully vaccinated, unless they are New Zealand citizens.\\nIn the first quarter of 2022, increasing numbers of fully vaccinated international travellers will be able to skip quarantine and self-isolate. This step in the new MIQ regime will be dependent upon the country transitioning to its new traffic light system.\\nNew Zealand Covid: Māori party likens new ‘traffic light’ system to ‘Squid Game’\\nRead more\\nHipkins said: “My message to all New Zealanders, whether they’re here or abroad is a very, very simple one. Get vaccinated. Then we can all get back to doing the things that we love and to seeing the people that we love.”\\nBut New Zealanders stranded overseas and desperate to get home are feeling dissatisfied with the announcement.\\nRikki Sands, a New Zealand citizen based in Brisbane, has entered the MIQ lottery 4 times without success. Sands, who is a specialised mechanical and hydraulic engineer, his wife and two daughters have been planning to come home since the beginning of the year.\\n“I’ve got more chance of winning lotto than an MIQ spot at the moment,” Sands said.\\nHe said the freeing up of 1,500 more MIQ spots was negligible, and did not give him any confidence he would get home sooner.\\nAnd he believes the justifications are unfair. “They said that the reason they can’t open the borders is because the local people aren’t getting vaccinated. But some of the ones that are coming in internationally are all going to be double vaccinated.\\n“Our family is all double-vaxxed and coming from Brisbane, Australia, which is a very low risk area, and we will be getting whatever tests are required before we fly. We just want to get home to our whānau [family].”',\n",

Stop Mandatory Vaccination has more than 150,000 approved members. Vitamin C Against Vaccine Damage claims that large doses of the vitamin can “heal” people from vaccine damage, even though vaccines are safe.\\nHealth experts are calling on Facebook to do more to counter these echo chambers. Dr Wendy Sue Swanson, spokeswoman of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said: “Facebook should prioritise dealing with the threat to human health when falsehoods and misinformation are shared. This isn’t just self-harm, it’s community harm.”\\nSwanson recently met with Facebook strategists and raised her concerns. “Parents deserve the truth. If they are being served up something that is not true it will likely increase their levels of anxiety and fear and potentially change their uptake of vaccines, which is dangerous,” she said.\\nFiona O’Leary, an autism activist and campaigner against pseudo-science, called on Facebook to block anti-vaccine groups. “If they won’t shut down closed groups I’d like to see a Facebook watchdog that will remove misinformation causing harm to children,” she said.\\nThe threat posed by the Facebook groups was put in stark relief by the World Health Organization (WHO), which lists “vaccine hesitancy” – reluctance to vaccinate – as one of the top 10 global health threats in 2019. The WHO points to a 30% worldwide increase in measles, a highly contagious illness that can cause deafness, brain inflammation, pneumonia and death, especially in children.\\nLast month Washington state imposed a state of emergency after 48 people contracted measles. Most of those infected were unvaccinated and under 10 years old.\\nDr Noni MacDonald, a professor of pediatrics at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, who has worked as an expert adviser to the WHO on immunization, questioned why Facebook was unrestrained by the stringent controls against misinformation put on drug companies. “We don’t let big pharma or big food or big radio companies do this, so why should we let this happen in this venue?”\\nShe added: “When a drug company puts a drug up in the formal media, they can’t tell you something false or they will be sued. So why is this different? Why is this allowed?”\\nAs concern grows about measles outbreaks in the US, the spotlight is increasingly falling on the closed anti-vaccination Facebook groups.

Twenty-four-pound bags of the powder cost $432.\\nRevitalize Wellness carries a disclaimer saying that its products are “not intended to treat, diagnose, cure or prevent disease”.

Otherwise, he said, the region could end up facing restrictions or possible lockdowns until Christmas.\\nHipkins said that the two infected people were co-operating with authorities but had not been scanning in using New Zealand’s location tracing app – a detail which may make contact tracing more difficult. Both are unvaccinated.\\nGiving a later update, the minister said that quarantine requirements for international arrivals would be eased next month.\\n“As vaccination rates have increased internationally, the number of Covid cases being picked up through our MIQ [managed isolation and quarantine] facilities has continued to decline. We now only get 2-3 cases per 1,000 arrivals and only around 1 in 2,000 is detected after seven days of isolation,” Hipkins said.\\nFrom 14 November, MIQ stays will be reduced from 14 days to seven, with travellers being tested on days zero, three and six. They will then isolate at home for short periods of around three days, and be tested again on day nine.\\nThis will likely free up about 1,500 rooms a month in MIQ, Hipkins said. Some of this will be taken up by community cases but some will go into the booking system for travellers from overseas.\\nOn 8 November, travellers from low-risk countries, starting with some Pacific islands, will be allowed to bypass MIQ altogether. Travellers will need to be fully vaccinated, unless they are New Zealand citizens.\\nIn the first quarter of 2022, increasing numbers of fully vaccinated international travellers will be able to skip quarantine and self-isolate. This step in the new MIQ regime will be dependent upon the country transitioning to its new traffic light system.\\nNew Zealand Covid: Māori party likens new ‘traffic light’ system to ‘Squid Game’\\nRead more\\nHipkins said: “My message to all New Zealanders, whether they’re here or abroad is a very, very simple one.

But some of the ones that are coming in internationally are all going to be double vaccinated.\\n“Our family is all double-vaxxed and coming from Brisbane, Australia, which is a very low risk area, and we will be getting whatever tests are required before we fly.

The WHO points to a 30% worldwide increase in measles, a highly contagious illness that can cause deafness, brain inflammation, pneumonia and death, especially in children.\\nLast month Washington state imposed a state of emergency after 48 people contracted measles. Most of those infected were unvaccinated and under 10 years old.\\nDr Noni MacDonald, a professor of pediatrics at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, who has worked as an expert adviser to the WHO on immunization, questioned why Facebook was unrestrained by the stringent controls against misinformation put on drug companies. “We don’t let big pharma or big food or big radio companies do this, so why should we let this happen in this venue?”\\nShe added: “When a drug company puts a drug up in the formal media, they can’t tell you something false or they will be sued.

Until they become safe and not driven by money I would avoid all vaccines.”\\nGironda is also listed as an administrator of a separate Facebook group called Vitamin C Against Vaccine Damage. She welcomes new approved members to the group with this statement: “Science and experience of mass amounts of people have proven that vaccines CAN damage the body … Vitamin C is the safest and most effective way to protect from damage for those that are mandated to be vaccinated.”\\nAfter the Guardian contacted Gironda, the status of the group Vitamin C Against Vaccine Damage was changed from closed to secret.

       "  'New Zealand’s South Island has recorded its first Covid cases in a major city in over a year, with two cases detected in Christchurch, as the government announced it will begin relaxing its strict international border settings.\\nCovid-19 response minister Chris Hipkins said at this stage there would be no snap lockdown for the city, the largest in the South Island, despite the fact one of the cases may have been infectious in the community for almost two weeks.\\n“This is a good reminder to people around the country that cases can pop up and this highlights the importance to get vaccinated,” Hipkins said.\\nBoth of Thursday’s new cases were members of the same household, and one had recently returned from Auckland.\\nNew Zealand announced 89 new cases of Covid-19 on Thursday, including the two in Christchurch. According to the Ministry of Health, 89% of eligible adults in Canterbury, of which Christchurch is the main city, had had at least one dose of the vaccine, and 67% had had both doses. The region would require almost 111,000 people to get both doses before hitting the 90% target set by the government, where most restrictions can be lifted. Across the country, 85% of the eligible population (those aged 12 and over) have had at least one dose of the vaccine, or 72% of the full population; 70% of the eligible population have had both doses, or 60% of the full population.\\nA catamaran and a plan: desperate to get home, New Zealanders set sail across the Tasman\\nRead more\\nEpidemiologist and public health prof Michael Baker said there needed to be stronger protections at the boundaries of the North and South Islands. “We may be seeding the whole South Island with cases right at the moment, because we’ve got increasing transmission in Auckland, and still people flying from Auckland all around the country – and we’ve got limited controls on that,” he said. Baker called for pre-departure testing, and for vaccine requirements on domestic flights.\\nDr Apisalome Talemaitoga, chair of the Pasifika GP network, said via the Science Media Centre, “I just find it unbelievable that we are allowing unvaccinated people out of Auckland to travel – for whatever reason. People should be doubly vaccinated before they can do this.”\\nWith the region still weeks away from 90% vaccination, Baker said there were “huge health and economic reasons for delaying widespread transmission in the South Island as long as possible”. Otherwise, he said, the region could end up facing restrictions or possible lockdowns until Christmas.\\nHipkins said that the two infected people were co-operating with authorities but had not been scanning in using New Zealand’s location tracing app – a detail which may make contact tracing more difficult. Both are unvaccinated.\\nGiving a later update, the minister said that quarantine requirements for international arrivals would be eased next month.\\n“As vaccination rates have increased internationally, the number of Covid cases being picked up through our MIQ [managed isolation and quarantine] facilities has continued to decline. We now only get 2-3 cases per 1,000 arrivals and only around 1 in 2,000 is detected after seven days of isolation,” Hipkins said.\\nFrom 14 November, MIQ stays will be reduced from 14 days to seven, with travellers being tested on days zero, three and six. They will then isolate at home for short periods of around three days, and be tested again on day nine.\\nThis will likely free up about 1,500 rooms a month in MIQ, Hipkins said. Some of this will be taken up by community cases but some will go into the booking system for travellers from overseas.\\nOn 8 November, travellers from low-risk countries, starting with some Pacific islands, will be allowed to bypass MIQ altogether. Travellers will need to be fully vaccinated, unless they are New Zealand citizens.\\nIn the first quarter of 2022, increasing numbers of fully vaccinated international travellers will be able to skip quarantine and self-isolate. This step in the new MIQ regime will be dependent upon the country transitioning to its new traffic light system.\\nNew Zealand Covid: Māori party likens new ‘traffic light’ system to ‘Squid Game’\\nRead more\\nHipkins said: “My message to all New Zealanders, whether they’re here or abroad is a very, very simple one. Get vaccinated. Then we can all get back to doing the things that we love and to seeing the people that we love.”\\nBut New Zealanders stranded overseas and desperate to get home are feeling dissatisfied with the announcement.\\nRikki Sands, a New Zealand citizen based in Brisbane, has entered the MIQ lottery 4 times without success. Sands, who is a specialised mechanical and hydraulic engineer, his wife and two daughters have been planning to come home since the beginning of the year.\\n“I’ve got more chance of winning lotto than an MIQ spot at the moment,” Sands said.\\nHe said the freeing up of 1,500 more MIQ spots was negligible, and did not give him any confidence he would get home sooner.\\nAnd he believes the justifications are unfair. “They said that the reason they can’t open the borders is because the local people aren’t getting vaccinated. But some of the ones that are coming in internationally are all going to be double vaccinated.\\n“Our family is all double-vaxxed and coming from Brisbane, Australia, which is a very low risk area, and we will be getting whatever tests are required before we fly.

       "  'New Zealand’s South Island has recorded its first Covid cases in a major city in over a year, with two cases detected in Christchurch, as the government announced it will begin relaxing its strict international border settings.\\nCovid-19 response minister Chris Hipkins said at this stage there would be no snap lockdown for the city, the largest in the South Island, despite the fact one of the cases may have been infectious in the community for almost two weeks.\\n“This is a good reminder to people around the country that cases can pop up and this highlights the importance to get vaccinated,” Hipkins said.\\nBoth of Thursday’s new cases were members of the same household, and one had recently returned from Auckland.\\nNew Zealand announced 89 new cases of Covid-19 on Thursday, including the two in Christchurch. According to the Ministry of Health, 89% of eligible adults in Canterbury, of which Christchurch is the main city, had had at least one dose of the vaccine, and 67% had had both doses. The region would require almost 111,000 people to get both doses before hitting the 90% target set by the government, where most restrictions can be lifted. Across the country, 85% of the eligible population (those aged 12 and over) have had at least one dose of the vaccine, or 72% of the full population; 70% of the eligible population have had both doses, or 60% of the full population.\\nA catamaran and a plan: desperate to get home, New Zealanders set sail across the Tasman\\nRead more\\nEpidemiologist and public health prof Michael Baker said there needed to be stronger protections at the boundaries of the North and South Islands. “We may be seeding the whole South Island with cases right at the moment, because we’ve got increasing transmission in Auckland, and still people flying from Auckland all around the country – and we’ve got limited controls on that,” he said. Baker called for pre-departure testing, and for vaccine requirements on domestic flights.\\nDr Apisalome Talemaitoga, chair of the Pasifika GP network, said via the Science Media Centre, “I just find it unbelievable that we are allowing unvaccinated people out of Auckland to travel – for whatever reason. People should be doubly vaccinated before they can do this.”\\nWith the region still weeks away from 90% vaccination, Baker said there were “huge health and economic reasons for delaying widespread transmission in the South Island as long as possible”. Otherwise, he said, the region could end up facing restrictions or possible lockdowns until Christmas.\\nHipkins said that the two infected people were co-operating with authorities but had not been scanning in using New Zealand’s location tracing app – a detail which may make contact tracing more difficult. Both are unvaccinated.\\nGiving a later update, the minister said that quarantine requirements for international arrivals would be eased next month.\\n“As vaccination rates have increased internationally, the number of Covid cases being picked up through our MIQ [managed isolation and quarantine] facilities has continued to decline. We now only get 2-3 cases per 1,000 arrivals and only around 1 in 2,000 is detected after seven days of isolation,” Hipkins said.\\nFrom 14 November, MIQ stays will be reduced from 14 days to seven, with travellers being tested on days zero, three and six. They will then isolate at home for short periods of around three days, and be tested again on day nine.\\nThis will likely free up about 1,500 rooms a month in MIQ, Hipkins said. Some of this will be taken up by community cases but some will go into the booking system for travellers from overseas.\\nOn 8 November, travellers from low-risk countries, starting with some Pacific islands, will be allowed to bypass MIQ altogether. Travellers will need to be fully vaccinated, unless they are New Zealand citizens.\\nIn the first quarter of 2022, increasing numbers of fully vaccinated international travellers will be able to skip quarantine and self-isolate. This step in the new MIQ regime will be dependent upon the country transitioning to its new traffic light system.\\nNew Zealand Covid: Māori party likens new ‘traffic light’ system to ‘Squid Game’\\nRead more\\nHipkins said: “My message to all New Zealanders, whether they’re here or abroad is a very, very simple one. Get vaccinated. Then we can all get back to doing the things that we love and to seeing the people that we love.”\\nBut New Zealanders stranded overseas and desperate to get home are feeling dissatisfied with the announcement.\\nRikki Sands, a New Zealand citizen based in Brisbane, has entered the MIQ lottery 4 times without success. Sands, who is a specialised mechanical and hydraulic engineer, his wife and two daughters have been planning to come home since the beginning of the year.\\n“I’ve got more chance of winning lotto than an MIQ spot at the moment,” Sands said.\\nHe said the freeing up of 1,500 more MIQ spots was negligible, and did not give him any confidence he would get home sooner.\\nAnd he believes the justifications are unfair. “They said that the reason they can’t open the borders is because the local people aren’t getting vaccinated. But some of the ones that are coming in internationally are all going to be double vaccinated.\\n“Our family is all double-vaxxed and coming from Brisbane, Australia, which is a very low risk area, and we will be getting whatever tests are required before we fly. We just want to get home to our whānau [family].”',\n",

Stop Mandatory Vaccination has more than 150,000 approved members. Vitamin C Against Vaccine Damage claims that large doses of the vitamin can “heal” people from vaccine damage, even though vaccines are safe.\\nHealth experts are calling on Facebook to do more to counter these echo chambers. Dr Wendy Sue Swanson, spokeswoman of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said: “Facebook should prioritise dealing with the threat to human health when falsehoods and misinformation are shared. This isn’t just self-harm, it’s community harm.”\\nSwanson recently met with Facebook strategists and raised her concerns. “Parents deserve the truth. If they are being served up something that is not true it will likely increase their levels of anxiety and fear and potentially change their uptake of vaccines, which is dangerous,” she said.\\nFiona O’Leary, an autism activist and campaigner against pseudo-science, called on Facebook to block anti-vaccine groups. “If they won’t shut down closed groups I’d like to see a Facebook watchdog that will remove misinformation causing harm to children,” she said.\\nThe threat posed by the Facebook groups was put in stark relief by the World Health Organization (WHO), which lists “vaccine hesitancy” – reluctance to vaccinate – as one of the top 10 global health threats in 2019. The WHO points to a 30% worldwide increase in measles, a highly contagious illness that can cause deafness, brain inflammation, pneumonia and death, especially in children.\\nLast month Washington state imposed a state of emergency after 48 people contracted measles. Most of those infected were unvaccinated and under 10 years old.\\nDr Noni MacDonald, a professor of pediatrics at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, who has worked as an expert adviser to the WHO on immunization, questioned why Facebook was unrestrained by the stringent controls against misinformation put on drug companies. “We don’t let big pharma or big food or big radio companies do this, so why should we let this happen in this venue?”\\nShe added: “When a drug company puts a drug up in the formal media, they can’t tell you something false or they will be sued. So why is this different? Why is this allowed?”\\nAs concern grows about measles outbreaks in the US, the spotlight is increasingly falling on the closed anti-vaccination Facebook groups.

Twenty-four-pound bags of the powder cost $432.\\nRevitalize Wellness carries a disclaimer saying that its products are “not intended to treat, diagnose, cure or prevent disease”.

Otherwise, he said, the region could end up facing restrictions or possible lockdowns until Christmas.\\nHipkins said that the two infected people were co-operating with authorities but had not been scanning in using New Zealand’s location tracing app – a detail which may make contact tracing more difficult. Both are unvaccinated.\\nGiving a later update, the minister said that quarantine requirements for international arrivals would be eased next month.\\n“As vaccination rates have increased internationally, the number of Covid cases being picked up through our MIQ [managed isolation and quarantine] facilities has continued to decline. We now only get 2-3 cases per 1,000 arrivals and only around 1 in 2,000 is detected after seven days of isolation,” Hipkins said.\\nFrom 14 November, MIQ stays will be reduced from 14 days to seven, with travellers being tested on days zero, three and six. They will then isolate at home for short periods of around three days, and be tested again on day nine.\\nThis will likely free up about 1,500 rooms a month in MIQ, Hipkins said. Some of this will be taken up by community cases but some will go into the booking system for travellers from overseas.\\nOn 8 November, travellers from low-risk countries, starting with some Pacific islands, will be allowed to bypass MIQ altogether. Travellers will need to be fully vaccinated, unless they are New Zealand citizens.\\nIn the first quarter of 2022, increasing numbers of fully vaccinated international travellers will be able to skip quarantine and self-isolate. This step in the new MIQ regime will be dependent upon the country transitioning to its new traffic light system.\\nNew Zealand Covid: Māori party likens new ‘traffic light’ system to ‘Squid Game’\\nRead more\\nHipkins said: “My message to all New Zealanders, whether they’re here or abroad is a very, very simple one.

But some of the ones that are coming in internationally are all going to be double vaccinated.\\n“Our family is all double-vaxxed and coming from Brisbane, Australia, which is a very low risk area, and we will be getting whatever tests are required before we fly.

The WHO points to a 30% worldwide increase in measles, a highly contagious illness that can cause deafness, brain inflammation, pneumonia and death, especially in children.\\nLast month Washington state imposed a state of emergency after 48 people contracted measles. Most of those infected were unvaccinated and under 10 years old.\\nDr Noni MacDonald, a professor of pediatrics at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, who has worked as an expert adviser to the WHO on immunization, questioned why Facebook was unrestrained by the stringent controls against misinformation put on drug companies. “We don’t let big pharma or big food or big radio companies do this, so why should we let this happen in this venue?”\\nShe added: “When a drug company puts a drug up in the formal media, they can’t tell you something false or they will be sued.

Until they become safe and not driven by money I would avoid all vaccines.”\\nGironda is also listed as an administrator of a separate Facebook group called Vitamin C Against Vaccine Damage. She welcomes new approved members to the group with this statement: “Science and experience of mass amounts of people have proven that vaccines CAN damage the body … Vitamin C is the safest and most effective way to protect from damage for those that are mandated to be vaccinated.”\\nAfter the Guardian contacted Gironda, the status of the group Vitamin C Against Vaccine Damage was changed from closed to secret.

       "  'New Zealand’s South Island has recorded its first Covid cases in a major city in over a year, with two cases detected in Christchurch, as the government announced it will begin relaxing its strict international border settings.\\nCovid-19 response minister Chris Hipkins said at this stage there would be no snap lockdown for the city, the largest in the South Island, despite the fact one of the cases may have been infectious in the community for almost two weeks.\\n“This is a good reminder to people around the country that cases can pop up and this highlights the importance to get vaccinated,” Hipkins said.\\nBoth of Thursday’s new cases were members of the same household, and one had recently returned from Auckland.\\nNew Zealand announced 89 new cases of Covid-19 on Thursday, including the two in Christchurch. According to the Ministry of Health, 89% of eligible adults in Canterbury, of which Christchurch is the main city, had had at least one dose of the vaccine, and 67% had had both doses. The region would require almost 111,000 people to get both doses before hitting the 90% target set by the government, where most restrictions can be lifted. Across the country, 85% of the eligible population (those aged 12 and over) have had at least one dose of the vaccine, or 72% of the full population; 70% of the eligible population have had both doses, or 60% of the full population.\\nA catamaran and a plan: desperate to get home, New Zealanders set sail across the Tasman\\nRead more\\nEpidemiologist and public health prof Michael Baker said there needed to be stronger protections at the boundaries of the North and South Islands. “We may be seeding the whole South Island with cases right at the moment, because we’ve got increasing transmission in Auckland, and still people flying from Auckland all around the country – and we’ve got limited controls on that,” he said. Baker called for pre-departure testing, and for vaccine requirements on domestic flights.\\nDr Apisalome Talemaitoga, chair of the Pasifika GP network, said via the Science Media Centre, “I just find it unbelievable that we are allowing unvaccinated people out of Auckland to travel – for whatever reason. People should be doubly vaccinated before they can do this.”\\nWith the region still weeks away from 90% vaccination, Baker said there were “huge health and economic reasons for delaying widespread transmission in the South Island as long as possible”. Otherwise, he said, the region could end up facing restrictions or possible lockdowns until Christmas.\\nHipkins said that the two infected people were co-operating with authorities but had not been scanning in using New Zealand’s location tracing app – a detail which may make contact tracing more difficult. Both are unvaccinated.\\nGiving a later update, the minister said that quarantine requirements for international arrivals would be eased next month.\\n“As vaccination rates have increased internationally, the number of Covid cases being picked up through our MIQ [managed isolation and quarantine] facilities has continued to decline. We now only get 2-3 cases per 1,000 arrivals and only around 1 in 2,000 is detected after seven days of isolation,” Hipkins said.\\nFrom 14 November, MIQ stays will be reduced from 14 days to seven, with travellers being tested on days zero, three and six. They will then isolate at home for short periods of around three days, and be tested again on day nine.\\nThis will likely free up about 1,500 rooms a month in MIQ, Hipkins said. Some of this will be taken up by community cases but some will go into the booking system for travellers from overseas.\\nOn 8 November, travellers from low-risk countries, starting with some Pacific islands, will be allowed to bypass MIQ altogether. Travellers will need to be fully vaccinated, unless they are New Zealand citizens.\\nIn the first quarter of 2022, increasing numbers of fully vaccinated international travellers will be able to skip quarantine and self-isolate. This step in the new MIQ regime will be dependent upon the country transitioning to its new traffic light system.\\nNew Zealand Covid: Māori party likens new ‘traffic light’ system to ‘Squid Game’\\nRead more\\nHipkins said: “My message to all New Zealanders, whether they’re here or abroad is a very, very simple one. Get vaccinated. Then we can all get back to doing the things that we love and to seeing the people that we love.”\\nBut New Zealanders stranded overseas and desperate to get home are feeling dissatisfied with the announcement.\\nRikki Sands, a New Zealand citizen based in Brisbane, has entered the MIQ lottery 4 times without success. Sands, who is a specialised mechanical and hydraulic engineer, his wife and two daughters have been planning to come home since the beginning of the year.\\n“I’ve got more chance of winning lotto than an MIQ spot at the moment,” Sands said.\\nHe said the freeing up of 1,500 more MIQ spots was negligible, and did not give him any confidence he would get home sooner.\\nAnd he believes the justifications are unfair. “They said that the reason they can’t open the borders is because the local people aren’t getting vaccinated. But some of the ones that are coming in internationally are all going to be double vaccinated.\\n“Our family is all double-vaxxed and coming from Brisbane, Australia, which is a very low risk area, and we will be getting whatever tests are required before we fly.

       "  'New Zealand’s South Island has recorded its first Covid cases in a major city in over a year, with two cases detected in Christchurch, as the government announced it will begin relaxing its strict international border settings.\\nCovid-19 response minister Chris Hipkins said at this stage there would be no snap lockdown for the city, the largest in the South Island, despite the fact one of the cases may have been infectious in the community for almost two weeks.\\n“This is a good reminder to people around the country that cases can pop up and this highlights the importance to get vaccinated,” Hipkins said.\\nBoth of Thursday’s new cases were members of the same household, and one had recently returned from Auckland.\\nNew Zealand announced 89 new cases of Covid-19 on Thursday, including the two in Christchurch. According to the Ministry of Health, 89% of eligible adults in Canterbury, of which Christchurch is the main city, had had at least one dose of the vaccine, and 67% had had both doses. The region would require almost 111,000 people to get both doses before hitting the 90% target set by the government, where most restrictions can be lifted. Across the country, 85% of the eligible population (those aged 12 and over) have had at least one dose of the vaccine, or 72% of the full population; 70% of the eligible population have had both doses, or 60% of the full population.\\nA catamaran and a plan: desperate to get home, New Zealanders set sail across the Tasman\\nRead more\\nEpidemiologist and public health prof Michael Baker said there needed to be stronger protections at the boundaries of the North and South Islands. “We may be seeding the whole South Island with cases right at the moment, because we’ve got increasing transmission in Auckland, and still people flying from Auckland all around the country – and we’ve got limited controls on that,” he said. Baker called for pre-departure testing, and for vaccine requirements on domestic flights.\\nDr Apisalome Talemaitoga, chair of the Pasifika GP network, said via the Science Media Centre, “I just find it unbelievable that we are allowing unvaccinated people out of Auckland to travel – for whatever reason. People should be doubly vaccinated before they can do this.”\\nWith the region still weeks away from 90% vaccination, Baker said there were “huge health and economic reasons for delaying widespread transmission in the South Island as long as possible”. Otherwise, he said, the region could end up facing restrictions or possible lockdowns until Christmas.\\nHipkins said that the two infected people were co-operating with authorities but had not been scanning in using New Zealand’s location tracing app – a detail which may make contact tracing more difficult. Both are unvaccinated.\\nGiving a later update, the minister said that quarantine requirements for international arrivals would be eased next month.\\n“As vaccination rates have increased internationally, the number of Covid cases being picked up through our MIQ [managed isolation and quarantine] facilities has continued to decline. We now only get 2-3 cases per 1,000 arrivals and only around 1 in 2,000 is detected after seven days of isolation,” Hipkins said.\\nFrom 14 November, MIQ stays will be reduced from 14 days to seven, with travellers being tested on days zero, three and six. They will then isolate at home for short periods of around three days, and be tested again on day nine.\\nThis will likely free up about 1,500 rooms a month in MIQ, Hipkins said. Some of this will be taken up by community cases but some will go into the booking system for travellers from overseas.\\nOn 8 November, travellers from low-risk countries, starting with some Pacific islands, will be allowed to bypass MIQ altogether. Travellers will need to be fully vaccinated, unless they are New Zealand citizens.\\nIn the first quarter of 2022, increasing numbers of fully vaccinated international travellers will be able to skip quarantine and self-isolate. This step in the new MIQ regime will be dependent upon the country transitioning to its new traffic light system.\\nNew Zealand Covid: Māori party likens new ‘traffic light’ system to ‘Squid Game’\\nRead more\\nHipkins said: “My message to all New Zealanders, whether they’re here or abroad is a very, very simple one. Get vaccinated. Then we can all get back to doing the things that we love and to seeing the people that we love.”\\nBut New Zealanders stranded overseas and desperate to get home are feeling dissatisfied with the announcement.\\nRikki Sands, a New Zealand citizen based in Brisbane, has entered the MIQ lottery 4 times without success. Sands, who is a specialised mechanical and hydraulic engineer, his wife and two daughters have been planning to come home since the beginning of the year.\\n“I’ve got more chance of winning lotto than an MIQ spot at the moment,” Sands said.\\nHe said the freeing up of 1,500 more MIQ spots was negligible, and did not give him any confidence he would get home sooner.\\nAnd he believes the justifications are unfair. “They said that the reason they can’t open the borders is because the local people aren’t getting vaccinated. But some of the ones that are coming in internationally are all going to be double vaccinated.\\n“Our family is all double-vaxxed and coming from Brisbane, Australia, which is a very low risk area, and we will be getting whatever tests are required before we fly. We just want to get home to our whānau [family].”',\n",

Stop Mandatory Vaccination has more than 150,000 approved members. Vitamin C Against Vaccine Damage claims that large doses of the vitamin can “heal” people from vaccine damage, even though vaccines are safe.\\nHealth experts are calling on Facebook to do more to counter these echo chambers. Dr Wendy Sue Swanson, spokeswoman of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said: “Facebook should prioritise dealing with the threat to human health when falsehoods and misinformation are shared. This isn’t just self-harm, it’s community harm.”\\nSwanson recently met with Facebook strategists and raised her concerns. “Parents deserve the truth. If they are being served up something that is not true it will likely increase their levels of anxiety and fear and potentially change their uptake of vaccines, which is dangerous,” she said.\\nFiona O’Leary, an autism activist and campaigner against pseudo-science, called on Facebook to block anti-vaccine groups. “If they won’t shut down closed groups I’d like to see a Facebook watchdog that will remove misinformation causing harm to children,” she said.\\nThe threat posed by the Facebook groups was put in stark relief by the World Health Organization (WHO), which lists “vaccine hesitancy” – reluctance to vaccinate – as one of the top 10 global health threats in 2019. The WHO points to a 30% worldwide increase in measles, a highly contagious illness that can cause deafness, brain inflammation, pneumonia and death, especially in children.\\nLast month Washington state imposed a state of emergency after 48 people contracted measles. Most of those infected were unvaccinated and under 10 years old.\\nDr Noni MacDonald, a professor of pediatrics at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, who has worked as an expert adviser to the WHO on immunization, questioned why Facebook was unrestrained by the stringent controls against misinformation put on drug companies. “We don’t let big pharma or big food or big radio companies do this, so why should we let this happen in this venue?”\\nShe added: “When a drug company puts a drug up in the formal media, they can’t tell you something false or they will be sued. So why is this different? Why is this allowed?”\\nAs concern grows about measles outbreaks in the US, the spotlight is increasingly falling on the closed anti-vaccination Facebook groups.

Twenty-four-pound bags of the powder cost $432.\\nRevitalize Wellness carries a disclaimer saying that its products are “not intended to treat, diagnose, cure or prevent disease”.

Otherwise, he said, the region could end up facing restrictions or possible lockdowns until Christmas.\\nHipkins said that the two infected people were co-operating with authorities but had not been scanning in using New Zealand’s location tracing app – a detail which may make contact tracing more difficult. Both are unvaccinated.\\nGiving a later update, the minister said that quarantine requirements for international arrivals would be eased next month.\\n“As vaccination rates have increased internationally, the number of Covid cases being picked up through our MIQ [managed isolation and quarantine] facilities has continued to decline. We now only get 2-3 cases per 1,000 arrivals and only around 1 in 2,000 is detected after seven days of isolation,” Hipkins said.\\nFrom 14 November, MIQ stays will be reduced from 14 days to seven, with travellers being tested on days zero, three and six. They will then isolate at home for short periods of around three days, and be tested again on day nine.\\nThis will likely free up about 1,500 rooms a month in MIQ, Hipkins said. Some of this will be taken up by community cases but some will go into the booking system for travellers from overseas.\\nOn 8 November, travellers from low-risk countries, starting with some Pacific islands, will be allowed to bypass MIQ altogether. Travellers will need to be fully vaccinated, unless they are New Zealand citizens.\\nIn the first quarter of 2022, increasing numbers of fully vaccinated international travellers will be able to skip quarantine and self-isolate. This step in the new MIQ regime will be dependent upon the country transitioning to its new traffic light system.\\nNew Zealand Covid: Māori party likens new ‘traffic light’ system to ‘Squid Game’\\nRead more\\nHipkins said: “My message to all New Zealanders, whether they’re here or abroad is a very, very simple one.

But some of the ones that are coming in internationally are all going to be double vaccinated.\\n“Our family is all double-vaxxed and coming from Brisbane, Australia, which is a very low risk area, and we will be getting whatever tests are required before we fly.

The WHO points to a 30% worldwide increase in measles, a highly contagious illness that can cause deafness, brain inflammation, pneumonia and death, especially in children.\\nLast month Washington state imposed a state of emergency after 48 people contracted measles. Most of those infected were unvaccinated and under 10 years old.\\nDr Noni MacDonald, a professor of pediatrics at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, who has worked as an expert adviser to the WHO on immunization, questioned why Facebook was unrestrained by the stringent controls against misinformation put on drug companies. “We don’t let big pharma or big food or big radio companies do this, so why should we let this happen in this venue?”\\nShe added: “When a drug company puts a drug up in the formal media, they can’t tell you something false or they will be sued.

Until they become safe and not driven by money I would avoid all vaccines.”\\nGironda is also listed as an administrator of a separate Facebook group called Vitamin C Against Vaccine Damage. She welcomes new approved members to the group with this statement: “Science and experience of mass amounts of people have proven that vaccines CAN damage the body … Vitamin C is the safest and most effective way to protect from damage for those that are mandated to be vaccinated.”\\nAfter the Guardian contacted Gironda, the status of the group Vitamin C Against Vaccine Damage was changed from closed to secret.

       "  'New Zealand’s South Island has recorded its first Covid cases in a major city in over a year, with two cases detected in Christchurch, as the government announced it will begin relaxing its strict international border settings.\\nCovid-19 response minister Chris Hipkins said at this stage there would be no snap lockdown for the city, the largest in the South Island, despite the fact one of the cases may have been infectious in the community for almost two weeks.\\n“This is a good reminder to people around the country that cases can pop up and this highlights the importance to get vaccinated,” Hipkins said.\\nBoth of Thursday’s new cases were members of the same household, and one had recently returned from Auckland.\\nNew Zealand announced 89 new cases of Covid-19 on Thursday, including the two in Christchurch. According to the Ministry of Health, 89% of eligible adults in Canterbury, of which Christchurch is the main city, had had at least one dose of the vaccine, and 67% had had both doses. The region would require almost 111,000 people to get both doses before hitting the 90% target set by the government, where most restrictions can be lifted. Across the country, 85% of the eligible population (those aged 12 and over) have had at least one dose of the vaccine, or 72% of the full population; 70% of the eligible population have had both doses, or 60% of the full population.\\nA catamaran and a plan: desperate to get home, New Zealanders set sail across the Tasman\\nRead more\\nEpidemiologist and public health prof Michael Baker said there needed to be stronger protections at the boundaries of the North and South Islands. “We may be seeding the whole South Island with cases right at the moment, because we’ve got increasing transmission in Auckland, and still people flying from Auckland all around the country – and we’ve got limited controls on that,” he said. Baker called for pre-departure testing, and for vaccine requirements on domestic flights.\\nDr Apisalome Talemaitoga, chair of the Pasifika GP network, said via the Science Media Centre, “I just find it unbelievable that we are allowing unvaccinated people out of Auckland to travel – for whatever reason. People should be doubly vaccinated before they can do this.”\\nWith the region still weeks away from 90% vaccination, Baker said there were “huge health and economic reasons for delaying widespread transmission in the South Island as long as possible”. Otherwise, he said, the region could end up facing restrictions or possible lockdowns until Christmas.\\nHipkins said that the two infected people were co-operating with authorities but had not been scanning in using New Zealand’s location tracing app – a detail which may make contact tracing more difficult. Both are unvaccinated.\\nGiving a later update, the minister said that quarantine requirements for international arrivals would be eased next month.\\n“As vaccination rates have increased internationally, the number of Covid cases being picked up through our MIQ [managed isolation and quarantine] facilities has continued to decline. We now only get 2-3 cases per 1,000 arrivals and only around 1 in 2,000 is detected after seven days of isolation,” Hipkins said.\\nFrom 14 November, MIQ stays will be reduced from 14 days to seven, with travellers being tested on days zero, three and six. They will then isolate at home for short periods of around three days, and be tested again on day nine.\\nThis will likely free up about 1,500 rooms a month in MIQ, Hipkins said. Some of this will be taken up by community cases but some will go into the booking system for travellers from overseas.\\nOn 8 November, travellers from low-risk countries, starting with some Pacific islands, will be allowed to bypass MIQ altogether. Travellers will need to be fully vaccinated, unless they are New Zealand citizens.\\nIn the first quarter of 2022, increasing numbers of fully vaccinated international travellers will be able to skip quarantine and self-isolate. This step in the new MIQ regime will be dependent upon the country transitioning to its new traffic light system.\\nNew Zealand Covid: Māori party likens new ‘traffic light’ system to ‘Squid Game’\\nRead more\\nHipkins said: “My message to all New Zealanders, whether they’re here or abroad is a very, very simple one. Get vaccinated. Then we can all get back to doing the things that we love and to seeing the people that we love.”\\nBut New Zealanders stranded overseas and desperate to get home are feeling dissatisfied with the announcement.\\nRikki Sands, a New Zealand citizen based in Brisbane, has entered the MIQ lottery 4 times without success. Sands, who is a specialised mechanical and hydraulic engineer, his wife and two daughters have been planning to come home since the beginning of the year.\\n“I’ve got more chance of winning lotto than an MIQ spot at the moment,” Sands said.\\nHe said the freeing up of 1,500 more MIQ spots was negligible, and did not give him any confidence he would get home sooner.\\nAnd he believes the justifications are unfair. “They said that the reason they can’t open the borders is because the local people aren’t getting vaccinated. But some of the ones that are coming in internationally are all going to be double vaccinated.\\n“Our family is all double-vaxxed and coming from Brisbane, Australia, which is a very low risk area, and we will be getting whatever tests are required before we fly.

       "  'New Zealand’s South Island has recorded its first Covid cases in a major city in over a year, with two cases detected in Christchurch, as the government announced it will begin relaxing its strict international border settings.\\nCovid-19 response minister Chris Hipkins said at this stage there would be no snap lockdown for the city, the largest in the South Island, despite the fact one of the cases may have been infectious in the community for almost two weeks.\\n“This is a good reminder to people around the country that cases can pop up and this highlights the importance to get vaccinated,” Hipkins said.\\nBoth of Thursday’s new cases were members of the same household, and one had recently returned from Auckland.\\nNew Zealand announced 89 new cases of Covid-19 on Thursday, including the two in Christchurch. According to the Ministry of Health, 89% of eligible adults in Canterbury, of which Christchurch is the main city, had had at least one dose of the vaccine, and 67% had had both doses. The region would require almost 111,000 people to get both doses before hitting the 90% target set by the government, where most restrictions can be lifted. Across the country, 85% of the eligible population (those aged 12 and over) have had at least one dose of the vaccine, or 72% of the full population; 70% of the eligible population have had both doses, or 60% of the full population.\\nA catamaran and a plan: desperate to get home, New Zealanders set sail across the Tasman\\nRead more\\nEpidemiologist and public health prof Michael Baker said there needed to be stronger protections at the boundaries of the North and South Islands. “We may be seeding the whole South Island with cases right at the moment, because we’ve got increasing transmission in Auckland, and still people flying from Auckland all around the country – and we’ve got limited controls on that,” he said. Baker called for pre-departure testing, and for vaccine requirements on domestic flights.\\nDr Apisalome Talemaitoga, chair of the Pasifika GP network, said via the Science Media Centre, “I just find it unbelievable that we are allowing unvaccinated people out of Auckland to travel – for whatever reason. People should be doubly vaccinated before they can do this.”\\nWith the region still weeks away from 90% vaccination, Baker said there were “huge health and economic reasons for delaying widespread transmission in the South Island as long as possible”. Otherwise, he said, the region could end up facing restrictions or possible lockdowns until Christmas.\\nHipkins said that the two infected people were co-operating with authorities but had not been scanning in using New Zealand’s location tracing app – a detail which may make contact tracing more difficult. Both are unvaccinated.\\nGiving a later update, the minister said that quarantine requirements for international arrivals would be eased next month.\\n“As vaccination rates have increased internationally, the number of Covid cases being picked up through our MIQ [managed isolation and quarantine] facilities has continued to decline. We now only get 2-3 cases per 1,000 arrivals and only around 1 in 2,000 is detected after seven days of isolation,” Hipkins said.\\nFrom 14 November, MIQ stays will be reduced from 14 days to seven, with travellers being tested on days zero, three and six. They will then isolate at home for short periods of around three days, and be tested again on day nine.\\nThis will likely free up about 1,500 rooms a month in MIQ, Hipkins said. Some of this will be taken up by community cases but some will go into the booking system for travellers from overseas.\\nOn 8 November, travellers from low-risk countries, starting with some Pacific islands, will be allowed to bypass MIQ altogether. Travellers will need to be fully vaccinated, unless they are New Zealand citizens.\\nIn the first quarter of 2022, increasing numbers of fully vaccinated international travellers will be able to skip quarantine and self-isolate. This step in the new MIQ regime will be dependent upon the country transitioning to its new traffic light system.\\nNew Zealand Covid: Māori party likens new ‘traffic light’ system to ‘Squid Game’\\nRead more\\nHipkins said: “My message to all New Zealanders, whether they’re here or abroad is a very, very simple one. Get vaccinated. Then we can all get back to doing the things that we love and to seeing the people that we love.”\\nBut New Zealanders stranded overseas and desperate to get home are feeling dissatisfied with the announcement.\\nRikki Sands, a New Zealand citizen based in Brisbane, has entered the MIQ lottery 4 times without success. Sands, who is a specialised mechanical and hydraulic engineer, his wife and two daughters have been planning to come home since the beginning of the year.\\n“I’ve got more chance of winning lotto than an MIQ spot at the moment,” Sands said.\\nHe said the freeing up of 1,500 more MIQ spots was negligible, and did not give him any confidence he would get home sooner.\\nAnd he believes the justifications are unfair. “They said that the reason they can’t open the borders is because the local people aren’t getting vaccinated. But some of the ones that are coming in internationally are all going to be double vaccinated.\\n“Our family is all double-vaxxed and coming from Brisbane, Australia, which is a very low risk area, and we will be getting whatever tests are required before we fly. We just want to get home to our whānau [family].”',\n",

Stop Mandatory Vaccination has more than 150,000 approved members. Vitamin C Against Vaccine Damage claims that large doses of the vitamin can “heal” people from vaccine damage, even though vaccines are safe.\\nHealth experts are calling on Facebook to do more to counter these echo chambers. Dr Wendy Sue Swanson, spokeswoman of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said: “Facebook should prioritise dealing with the threat to human health when falsehoods and misinformation are shared. This isn’t just self-harm, it’s community harm.”\\nSwanson recently met with Facebook strategists and raised her concerns. “Parents deserve the truth. If they are being served up something that is not true it will likely increase their levels of anxiety and fear and potentially change their uptake of vaccines, which is dangerous,” she said.\\nFiona O’Leary, an autism activist and campaigner against pseudo-science, called on Facebook to block anti-vaccine groups. “If they won’t shut down closed groups I’d like to see a Facebook watchdog that will remove misinformation causing harm to children,” she said.\\nThe threat posed by the Facebook groups was put in stark relief by the World Health Organization (WHO), which lists “vaccine hesitancy” – reluctance to vaccinate – as one of the top 10 global health threats in 2019. The WHO points to a 30% worldwide increase in measles, a highly contagious illness that can cause deafness, brain inflammation, pneumonia and death, especially in children.\\nLast month Washington state imposed a state of emergency after 48 people contracted measles. Most of those infected were unvaccinated and under 10 years old.\\nDr Noni MacDonald, a professor of pediatrics at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, who has worked as an expert adviser to the WHO on immunization, questioned why Facebook was unrestrained by the stringent controls against misinformation put on drug companies. “We don’t let big pharma or big food or big radio companies do this, so why should we let this happen in this venue?”\\nShe added: “When a drug company puts a drug up in the formal media, they can’t tell you something false or they will be sued. So why is this different? Why is this allowed?”\\nAs concern grows about measles outbreaks in the US, the spotlight is increasingly falling on the closed anti-vaccination Facebook groups.

Twenty-four-pound bags of the powder cost $432.\\nRevitalize Wellness carries a disclaimer saying that its products are “not intended to treat, diagnose, cure or prevent disease”.

Otherwise, he said, the region could end up facing restrictions or possible lockdowns until Christmas.\\nHipkins said that the two infected people were co-operating with authorities but had not been scanning in using New Zealand’s location tracing app – a detail which may make contact tracing more difficult. Both are unvaccinated.\\nGiving a later update, the minister said that quarantine requirements for international arrivals would be eased next month.\\n“As vaccination rates have increased internationally, the number of Covid cases being picked up through our MIQ [managed isolation and quarantine] facilities has continued to decline. We now only get 2-3 cases per 1,000 arrivals and only around 1 in 2,000 is detected after seven days of isolation,” Hipkins said.\\nFrom 14 November, MIQ stays will be reduced from 14 days to seven, with travellers being tested on days zero, three and six. They will then isolate at home for short periods of around three days, and be tested again on day nine.\\nThis will likely free up about 1,500 rooms a month in MIQ, Hipkins said. Some of this will be taken up by community cases but some will go into the booking system for travellers from overseas.\\nOn 8 November, travellers from low-risk countries, starting with some Pacific islands, will be allowed to bypass MIQ altogether. Travellers will need to be fully vaccinated, unless they are New Zealand citizens.\\nIn the first quarter of 2022, increasing numbers of fully vaccinated international travellers will be able to skip quarantine and self-isolate. This step in the new MIQ regime will be dependent upon the country transitioning to its new traffic light system.\\nNew Zealand Covid: Māori party likens new ‘traffic light’ system to ‘Squid Game’\\nRead more\\nHipkins said: “My message to all New Zealanders, whether they’re here or abroad is a very, very simple one.

But some of the ones that are coming in internationally are all going to be double vaccinated.\\n“Our family is all double-vaxxed and coming from Brisbane, Australia, which is a very low risk area, and we will be getting whatever tests are required before we fly.

The WHO points to a 30% worldwide increase in measles, a highly contagious illness that can cause deafness, brain inflammation, pneumonia and death, especially in children.\\nLast month Washington state imposed a state of emergency after 48 people contracted measles. Most of those infected were unvaccinated and under 10 years old.\\nDr Noni MacDonald, a professor of pediatrics at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, who has worked as an expert adviser to the WHO on immunization, questioned why Facebook was unrestrained by the stringent controls against misinformation put on drug companies. “We don’t let big pharma or big food or big radio companies do this, so why should we let this happen in this venue?”\\nShe added: “When a drug company puts a drug up in the formal media, they can’t tell you something false or they will be sued.

Until they become safe and not driven by money I would avoid all vaccines.”\\nGironda is also listed as an administrator of a separate Facebook group called Vitamin C Against Vaccine Damage. She welcomes new approved members to the group with this statement: “Science and experience of mass amounts of people have proven that vaccines CAN damage the body … Vitamin C is the safest and most effective way to protect from damage for those that are mandated to be vaccinated.”\\nAfter the Guardian contacted Gironda, the status of the group Vitamin C Against Vaccine Damage was changed from closed to secret.

       "  'New Zealand’s South Island has recorded its first Covid cases in a major city in over a year, with two cases detected in Christchurch, as the government announced it will begin relaxing its strict international border settings.\\nCovid-19 response minister Chris Hipkins said at this stage there would be no snap lockdown for the city, the largest in the South Island, despite the fact one of the cases may have been infectious in the community for almost two weeks.\\n“This is a good reminder to people around the country that cases can pop up and this highlights the importance to get vaccinated,” Hipkins said.\\nBoth of Thursday’s new cases were members of the same household, and one had recently returned from Auckland.\\nNew Zealand announced 89 new cases of Covid-19 on Thursday, including the two in Christchurch. According to the Ministry of Health, 89% of eligible adults in Canterbury, of which Christchurch is the main city, had had at least one dose of the vaccine, and 67% had had both doses. The region would require almost 111,000 people to get both doses before hitting the 90% target set by the government, where most restrictions can be lifted. Across the country, 85% of the eligible population (those aged 12 and over) have had at least one dose of the vaccine, or 72% of the full population; 70% of the eligible population have had both doses, or 60% of the full population.\\nA catamaran and a plan: desperate to get home, New Zealanders set sail across the Tasman\\nRead more\\nEpidemiologist and public health prof Michael Baker said there needed to be stronger protections at the boundaries of the North and South Islands. “We may be seeding the whole South Island with cases right at the moment, because we’ve got increasing transmission in Auckland, and still people flying from Auckland all around the country – and we’ve got limited controls on that,” he said. Baker called for pre-departure testing, and for vaccine requirements on domestic flights.\\nDr Apisalome Talemaitoga, chair of the Pasifika GP network, said via the Science Media Centre, “I just find it unbelievable that we are allowing unvaccinated people out of Auckland to travel – for whatever reason. People should be doubly vaccinated before they can do this.”\\nWith the region still weeks away from 90% vaccination, Baker said there were “huge health and economic reasons for delaying widespread transmission in the South Island as long as possible”. Otherwise, he said, the region could end up facing restrictions or possible lockdowns until Christmas.\\nHipkins said that the two infected people were co-operating with authorities but had not been scanning in using New Zealand’s location tracing app – a detail which may make contact tracing more difficult. Both are unvaccinated.\\nGiving a later update, the minister said that quarantine requirements for international arrivals would be eased next month.\\n“As vaccination rates have increased internationally, the number of Covid cases being picked up through our MIQ [managed isolation and quarantine] facilities has continued to decline. We now only get 2-3 cases per 1,000 arrivals and only around 1 in 2,000 is detected after seven days of isolation,” Hipkins said.\\nFrom 14 November, MIQ stays will be reduced from 14 days to seven, with travellers being tested on days zero, three and six. They will then isolate at home for short periods of around three days, and be tested again on day nine.\\nThis will likely free up about 1,500 rooms a month in MIQ, Hipkins said. Some of this will be taken up by community cases but some will go into the booking system for travellers from overseas.\\nOn 8 November, travellers from low-risk countries, starting with some Pacific islands, will be allowed to bypass MIQ altogether. Travellers will need to be fully vaccinated, unless they are New Zealand citizens.\\nIn the first quarter of 2022, increasing numbers of fully vaccinated international travellers will be able to skip quarantine and self-isolate. This step in the new MIQ regime will be dependent upon the country transitioning to its new traffic light system.\\nNew Zealand Covid: Māori party likens new ‘traffic light’ system to ‘Squid Game’\\nRead more\\nHipkins said: “My message to all New Zealanders, whether they’re here or abroad is a very, very simple one. Get vaccinated. Then we can all get back to doing the things that we love and to seeing the people that we love.”\\nBut New Zealanders stranded overseas and desperate to get home are feeling dissatisfied with the announcement.\\nRikki Sands, a New Zealand citizen based in Brisbane, has entered the MIQ lottery 4 times without success. Sands, who is a specialised mechanical and hydraulic engineer, his wife and two daughters have been planning to come home since the beginning of the year.\\n“I’ve got more chance of winning lotto than an MIQ spot at the moment,” Sands said.\\nHe said the freeing up of 1,500 more MIQ spots was negligible, and did not give him any confidence he would get home sooner.\\nAnd he believes the justifications are unfair. “They said that the reason they can’t open the borders is because the local people aren’t getting vaccinated. But some of the ones that are coming in internationally are all going to be double vaccinated.\\n“Our family is all double-vaxxed and coming from Brisbane, Australia, which is a very low risk area, and we will be getting whatever tests are required before we fly.

       "  'New Zealand’s South Island has recorded its first Covid cases in a major city in over a year, with two cases detected in Christchurch, as the government announced it will begin relaxing its strict international border settings.\\nCovid-19 response minister Chris Hipkins said at this stage there would be no snap lockdown for the city, the largest in the South Island, despite the fact one of the cases may have been infectious in the community for almost two weeks.\\n“This is a good reminder to people around the country that cases can pop up and this highlights the importance to get vaccinated,” Hipkins said.\\nBoth of Thursday’s new cases were members of the same household, and one had recently returned from Auckland.\\nNew Zealand announced 89 new cases of Covid-19 on Thursday, including the two in Christchurch. According to the Ministry of Health, 89% of eligible adults in Canterbury, of which Christchurch is the main city, had had at least one dose of the vaccine, and 67% had had both doses. The region would require almost 111,000 people to get both doses before hitting the 90% target set by the government, where most restrictions can be lifted. Across the country, 85% of the eligible population (those aged 12 and over) have had at least one dose of the vaccine, or 72% of the full population; 70% of the eligible population have had both doses, or 60% of the full population.\\nA catamaran and a plan: desperate to get home, New Zealanders set sail across the Tasman\\nRead more\\nEpidemiologist and public health prof Michael Baker said there needed to be stronger protections at the boundaries of the North and South Islands. “We may be seeding the whole South Island with cases right at the moment, because we’ve got increasing transmission in Auckland, and still people flying from Auckland all around the country – and we’ve got limited controls on that,” he said. Baker called for pre-departure testing, and for vaccine requirements on domestic flights.\\nDr Apisalome Talemaitoga, chair of the Pasifika GP network, said via the Science Media Centre, “I just find it unbelievable that we are allowing unvaccinated people out of Auckland to travel – for whatever reason. People should be doubly vaccinated before they can do this.”\\nWith the region still weeks away from 90% vaccination, Baker said there were “huge health and economic reasons for delaying widespread transmission in the South Island as long as possible”. Otherwise, he said, the region could end up facing restrictions or possible lockdowns until Christmas.\\nHipkins said that the two infected people were co-operating with authorities but had not been scanning in using New Zealand’s location tracing app – a detail which may make contact tracing more difficult. Both are unvaccinated.\\nGiving a later update, the minister said that quarantine requirements for international arrivals would be eased next month.\\n“As vaccination rates have increased internationally, the number of Covid cases being picked up through our MIQ [managed isolation and quarantine] facilities has continued to decline. We now only get 2-3 cases per 1,000 arrivals and only around 1 in 2,000 is detected after seven days of isolation,” Hipkins said.\\nFrom 14 November, MIQ stays will be reduced from 14 days to seven, with travellers being tested on days zero, three and six. They will then isolate at home for short periods of around three days, and be tested again on day nine.\\nThis will likely free up about 1,500 rooms a month in MIQ, Hipkins said. Some of this will be taken up by community cases but some will go into the booking system for travellers from overseas.\\nOn 8 November, travellers from low-risk countries, starting with some Pacific islands, will be allowed to bypass MIQ altogether. Travellers will need to be fully vaccinated, unless they are New Zealand citizens.\\nIn the first quarter of 2022, increasing numbers of fully vaccinated international travellers will be able to skip quarantine and self-isolate. This step in the new MIQ regime will be dependent upon the country transitioning to its new traffic light system.\\nNew Zealand Covid: Māori party likens new ‘traffic light’ system to ‘Squid Game’\\nRead more\\nHipkins said: “My message to all New Zealanders, whether they’re here or abroad is a very, very simple one. Get vaccinated. Then we can all get back to doing the things that we love and to seeing the people that we love.”\\nBut New Zealanders stranded overseas and desperate to get home are feeling dissatisfied with the announcement.\\nRikki Sands, a New Zealand citizen based in Brisbane, has entered the MIQ lottery 4 times without success. Sands, who is a specialised mechanical and hydraulic engineer, his wife and two daughters have been planning to come home since the beginning of the year.\\n“I’ve got more chance of winning lotto than an MIQ spot at the moment,” Sands said.\\nHe said the freeing up of 1,500 more MIQ spots was negligible, and did not give him any confidence he would get home sooner.\\nAnd he believes the justifications are unfair. “They said that the reason they can’t open the borders is because the local people aren’t getting vaccinated. But some of the ones that are coming in internationally are all going to be double vaccinated.\\n“Our family is all double-vaxxed and coming from Brisbane, Australia, which is a very low risk area, and we will be getting whatever tests are required before we fly. We just want to get home to our whānau [family].”',\n",

Stop Mandatory Vaccination has more than 150,000 approved members. Vitamin C Against Vaccine Damage claims that large doses of the vitamin can “heal” people from vaccine damage, even though vaccines are safe.\\nHealth experts are calling on Facebook to do more to counter these echo chambers. Dr Wendy Sue Swanson, spokeswoman of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said: “Facebook should prioritise dealing with the threat to human health when falsehoods and misinformation are shared. This isn’t just self-harm, it’s community harm.”\\nSwanson recently met with Facebook strategists and raised her concerns. “Parents deserve the truth. If they are being served up something that is not true it will likely increase their levels of anxiety and fear and potentially change their uptake of vaccines, which is dangerous,” she said.\\nFiona O’Leary, an autism activist and campaigner against pseudo-science, called on Facebook to block anti-vaccine groups. “If they won’t shut down closed groups I’d like to see a Facebook watchdog that will remove misinformation causing harm to children,” she said.\\nThe threat posed by the Facebook groups was put in stark relief by the World Health Organization (WHO), which lists “vaccine hesitancy” – reluctance to vaccinate – as one of the top 10 global health threats in 2019. The WHO points to a 30% worldwide increase in measles, a highly contagious illness that can cause deafness, brain inflammation, pneumonia and death, especially in children.\\nLast month Washington state imposed a state of emergency after 48 people contracted measles. Most of those infected were unvaccinated and under 10 years old.\\nDr Noni MacDonald, a professor of pediatrics at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, who has worked as an expert adviser to the WHO on immunization, questioned why Facebook was unrestrained by the stringent controls against misinformation put on drug companies. “We don’t let big pharma or big food or big radio companies do this, so why should we let this happen in this venue?”\\nShe added: “When a drug company puts a drug up in the formal media, they can’t tell you something false or they will be sued. So why is this different? Why is this allowed?”\\nAs concern grows about measles outbreaks in the US, the spotlight is increasingly falling on the closed anti-vaccination Facebook groups.

Twenty-four-pound bags of the powder cost $432.\\nRevitalize Wellness carries a disclaimer saying that its products are “not intended to treat, diagnose, cure or prevent disease”.

Otherwise, he said, the region could end up facing restrictions or possible lockdowns until Christmas.\\nHipkins said that the two infected people were co-operating with authorities but had not been scanning in using New Zealand’s location tracing app – a detail which may make contact tracing more difficult. Both are unvaccinated.\\nGiving a later update, the minister said that quarantine requirements for international arrivals would be eased next month.\\n“As vaccination rates have increased internationally, the number of Covid cases being picked up through our MIQ [managed isolation and quarantine] facilities has continued to decline. We now only get 2-3 cases per 1,000 arrivals and only around 1 in 2,000 is detected after seven days of isolation,” Hipkins said.\\nFrom 14 November, MIQ stays will be reduced from 14 days to seven, with travellers being tested on days zero, three and six. They will then isolate at home for short periods of around three days, and be tested again on day nine.\\nThis will likely free up about 1,500 rooms a month in MIQ, Hipkins said. Some of this will be taken up by community cases but some will go into the booking system for travellers from overseas.\\nOn 8 November, travellers from low-risk countries, starting with some Pacific islands, will be allowed to bypass MIQ altogether. Travellers will need to be fully vaccinated, unless they are New Zealand citizens.\\nIn the first quarter of 2022, increasing numbers of fully vaccinated international travellers will be able to skip quarantine and self-isolate. This step in the new MIQ regime will be dependent upon the country transitioning to its new traffic light system.\\nNew Zealand Covid: Māori party likens new ‘traffic light’ system to ‘Squid Game’\\nRead more\\nHipkins said: “My message to all New Zealanders, whether they’re here or abroad is a very, very simple one.

But some of the ones that are coming in internationally are all going to be double vaccinated.\\n“Our family is all double-vaxxed and coming from Brisbane, Australia, which is a very low risk area, and we will be getting whatever tests are required before we fly.

The WHO points to a 30% worldwide increase in measles, a highly contagious illness that can cause deafness, brain inflammation, pneumonia and death, especially in children.\\nLast month Washington state imposed a state of emergency after 48 people contracted measles. Most of those infected were unvaccinated and under 10 years old.\\nDr Noni MacDonald, a professor of pediatrics at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, who has worked as an expert adviser to the WHO on immunization, questioned why Facebook was unrestrained by the stringent controls against misinformation put on drug companies. “We don’t let big pharma or big food or big radio companies do this, so why should we let this happen in this venue?”\\nShe added: “When a drug company puts a drug up in the formal media, they can’t tell you something false or they will be sued.

Until they become safe and not driven by money I would avoid all vaccines.”\\nGironda is also listed as an administrator of a separate Facebook group called Vitamin C Against Vaccine Damage. She welcomes new approved members to the group with this statement: “Science and experience of mass amounts of people have proven that vaccines CAN damage the body … Vitamin C is the safest and most effective way to protect from damage for those that are mandated to be vaccinated.”\\nAfter the Guardian contacted Gironda, the status of the group Vitamin C Against Vaccine Damage was changed from closed to secret.

       "  'New Zealand’s South Island has recorded its first Covid cases in a major city in over a year, with two cases detected in Christchurch, as the government announced it will begin relaxing its strict international border settings.\\nCovid-19 response minister Chris Hipkins said at this stage there would be no snap lockdown for the city, the largest in the South Island, despite the fact one of the cases may have been infectious in the community for almost two weeks.\\n“This is a good reminder to people around the country that cases can pop up and this highlights the importance to get vaccinated,” Hipkins said.\\nBoth of Thursday’s new cases were members of the same household, and one had recently returned from Auckland.\\nNew Zealand announced 89 new cases of Covid-19 on Thursday, including the two in Christchurch. According to the Ministry of Health, 89% of eligible adults in Canterbury, of which Christchurch is the main city, had had at least one dose of the vaccine, and 67% had had both doses. The region would require almost 111,000 people to get both doses before hitting the 90% target set by the government, where most restrictions can be lifted. Across the country, 85% of the eligible population (those aged 12 and over) have had at least one dose of the vaccine, or 72% of the full population; 70% of the eligible population have had both doses, or 60% of the full population.\\nA catamaran and a plan: desperate to get home, New Zealanders set sail across the Tasman\\nRead more\\nEpidemiologist and public health prof Michael Baker said there needed to be stronger protections at the boundaries of the North and South Islands. “We may be seeding the whole South Island with cases right at the moment, because we’ve got increasing transmission in Auckland, and still people flying from Auckland all around the country – and we’ve got limited controls on that,” he said. Baker called for pre-departure testing, and for vaccine requirements on domestic flights.\\nDr Apisalome Talemaitoga, chair of the Pasifika GP network, said via the Science Media Centre, “I just find it unbelievable that we are allowing unvaccinated people out of Auckland to travel – for whatever reason. People should be doubly vaccinated before they can do this.”\\nWith the region still weeks away from 90% vaccination, Baker said there were “huge health and economic reasons for delaying widespread transmission in the South Island as long as possible”. Otherwise, he said, the region could end up facing restrictions or possible lockdowns until Christmas.\\nHipkins said that the two infected people were co-operating with authorities but had not been scanning in using New Zealand’s location tracing app – a detail which may make contact tracing more difficult. Both are unvaccinated.\\nGiving a later update, the minister said that quarantine requirements for international arrivals would be eased next month.\\n“As vaccination rates have increased internationally, the number of Covid cases being picked up through our MIQ [managed isolation and quarantine] facilities has continued to decline. We now only get 2-3 cases per 1,000 arrivals and only around 1 in 2,000 is detected after seven days of isolation,” Hipkins said.\\nFrom 14 November, MIQ stays will be reduced from 14 days to seven, with travellers being tested on days zero, three and six. They will then isolate at home for short periods of around three days, and be tested again on day nine.\\nThis will likely free up about 1,500 rooms a month in MIQ, Hipkins said. Some of this will be taken up by community cases but some will go into the booking system for travellers from overseas.\\nOn 8 November, travellers from low-risk countries, starting with some Pacific islands, will be allowed to bypass MIQ altogether. Travellers will need to be fully vaccinated, unless they are New Zealand citizens.\\nIn the first quarter of 2022, increasing numbers of fully vaccinated international travellers will be able to skip quarantine and self-isolate. This step in the new MIQ regime will be dependent upon the country transitioning to its new traffic light system.\\nNew Zealand Covid: Māori party likens new ‘traffic light’ system to ‘Squid Game’\\nRead more\\nHipkins said: “My message to all New Zealanders, whether they’re here or abroad is a very, very simple one. Get vaccinated. Then we can all get back to doing the things that we love and to seeing the people that we love.”\\nBut New Zealanders stranded overseas and desperate to get home are feeling dissatisfied with the announcement.\\nRikki Sands, a New Zealand citizen based in Brisbane, has entered the MIQ lottery 4 times without success. Sands, who is a specialised mechanical and hydraulic engineer, his wife and two daughters have been planning to come home since the beginning of the year.\\n“I’ve got more chance of winning lotto than an MIQ spot at the moment,” Sands said.\\nHe said the freeing up of 1,500 more MIQ spots was negligible, and did not give him any confidence he would get home sooner.\\nAnd he believes the justifications are unfair. “They said that the reason they can’t open the borders is because the local people aren’t getting vaccinated. But some of the ones that are coming in internationally are all going to be double vaccinated.\\n“Our family is all double-vaxxed and coming from Brisbane, Australia, which is a very low risk area, and we will be getting whatever tests are required before we fly.

       "  'New Zealand’s South Island has recorded its first Covid cases in a major city in over a year, with two cases detected in Christchurch, as the government announced it will begin relaxing its strict international border settings.\\nCovid-19 response minister Chris Hipkins said at this stage there would be no snap lockdown for the city, the largest in the South Island, despite the fact one of the cases may have been infectious in the community for almost two weeks.\\n“This is a good reminder to people around the country that cases can pop up and this highlights the importance to get vaccinated,” Hipkins said.\\nBoth of Thursday’s new cases were members of the same household, and one had recently returned from Auckland.\\nNew Zealand announced 89 new cases of Covid-19 on Thursday, including the two in Christchurch. According to the Ministry of Health, 89% of eligible adults in Canterbury, of which Christchurch is the main city, had had at least one dose of the vaccine, and 67% had had both doses. The region would require almost 111,000 people to get both doses before hitting the 90% target set by the government, where most restrictions can be lifted. Across the country, 85% of the eligible population (those aged 12 and over) have had at least one dose of the vaccine, or 72% of the full population; 70% of the eligible population have had both doses, or 60% of the full population.\\nA catamaran and a plan: desperate to get home, New Zealanders set sail across the Tasman\\nRead more\\nEpidemiologist and public health prof Michael Baker said there needed to be stronger protections at the boundaries of the North and South Islands. “We may be seeding the whole South Island with cases right at the moment, because we’ve got increasing transmission in Auckland, and still people flying from Auckland all around the country – and we’ve got limited controls on that,” he said. Baker called for pre-departure testing, and for vaccine requirements on domestic flights.\\nDr Apisalome Talemaitoga, chair of the Pasifika GP network, said via the Science Media Centre, “I just find it unbelievable that we are allowing unvaccinated people out of Auckland to travel – for whatever reason. People should be doubly vaccinated before they can do this.”\\nWith the region still weeks away from 90% vaccination, Baker said there were “huge health and economic reasons for delaying widespread transmission in the South Island as long as possible”. Otherwise, he said, the region could end up facing restrictions or possible lockdowns until Christmas.\\nHipkins said that the two infected people were co-operating with authorities but had not been scanning in using New Zealand’s location tracing app – a detail which may make contact tracing more difficult. Both are unvaccinated.\\nGiving a later update, the minister said that quarantine requirements for international arrivals would be eased next month.\\n“As vaccination rates have increased internationally, the number of Covid cases being picked up through our MIQ [managed isolation and quarantine] facilities has continued to decline. We now only get 2-3 cases per 1,000 arrivals and only around 1 in 2,000 is detected after seven days of isolation,” Hipkins said.\\nFrom 14 November, MIQ stays will be reduced from 14 days to seven, with travellers being tested on days zero, three and six. They will then isolate at home for short periods of around three days, and be tested again on day nine.\\nThis will likely free up about 1,500 rooms a month in MIQ, Hipkins said. Some of this will be taken up by community cases but some will go into the booking system for travellers from overseas.\\nOn 8 November, travellers from low-risk countries, starting with some Pacific islands, will be allowed to bypass MIQ altogether. Travellers will need to be fully vaccinated, unless they are New Zealand citizens.\\nIn the first quarter of 2022, increasing numbers of fully vaccinated international travellers will be able to skip quarantine and self-isolate. This step in the new MIQ regime will be dependent upon the country transitioning to its new traffic light system.\\nNew Zealand Covid: Māori party likens new ‘traffic light’ system to ‘Squid Game’\\nRead more\\nHipkins said: “My message to all New Zealanders, whether they’re here or abroad is a very, very simple one. Get vaccinated. Then we can all get back to doing the things that we love and to seeing the people that we love.”\\nBut New Zealanders stranded overseas and desperate to get home are feeling dissatisfied with the announcement.\\nRikki Sands, a New Zealand citizen based in Brisbane, has entered the MIQ lottery 4 times without success. Sands, who is a specialised mechanical and hydraulic engineer, his wife and two daughters have been planning to come home since the beginning of the year.\\n“I’ve got more chance of winning lotto than an MIQ spot at the moment,” Sands said.\\nHe said the freeing up of 1,500 more MIQ spots was negligible, and did not give him any confidence he would get home sooner.\\nAnd he believes the justifications are unfair. “They said that the reason they can’t open the borders is because the local people aren’t getting vaccinated. But some of the ones that are coming in internationally are all going to be double vaccinated.\\n“Our family is all double-vaxxed and coming from Brisbane, Australia, which is a very low risk area, and we will be getting whatever tests are required before we fly. We just want to get home to our whānau [family].”',\n",

Stop Mandatory Vaccination has more than 150,000 approved members. Vitamin C Against Vaccine Damage claims that large doses of the vitamin can “heal” people from vaccine damage, even though vaccines are safe.\\nHealth experts are calling on Facebook to do more to counter these echo chambers. Dr Wendy Sue Swanson, spokeswoman of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said: “Facebook should prioritise dealing with the threat to human health when falsehoods and misinformation are shared. This isn’t just self-harm, it’s community harm.”\\nSwanson recently met with Facebook strategists and raised her concerns. “Parents deserve the truth. If they are being served up something that is not true it will likely increase their levels of anxiety and fear and potentially change their uptake of vaccines, which is dangerous,” she said.\\nFiona O’Leary, an autism activist and campaigner against pseudo-science, called on Facebook to block anti-vaccine groups. “If they won’t shut down closed groups I’d like to see a Facebook watchdog that will remove misinformation causing harm to children,” she said.\\nThe threat posed by the Facebook groups was put in stark relief by the World Health Organization (WHO), which lists “vaccine hesitancy” – reluctance to vaccinate – as one of the top 10 global health threats in 2019. The WHO points to a 30% worldwide increase in measles, a highly contagious illness that can cause deafness, brain inflammation, pneumonia and death, especially in children.\\nLast month Washington state imposed a state of emergency after 48 people contracted measles. Most of those infected were unvaccinated and under 10 years old.\\nDr Noni MacDonald, a professor of pediatrics at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, who has worked as an expert adviser to the WHO on immunization, questioned why Facebook was unrestrained by the stringent controls against misinformation put on drug companies. “We don’t let big pharma or big food or big radio companies do this, so why should we let this happen in this venue?”\\nShe added: “When a drug company puts a drug up in the formal media, they can’t tell you something false or they will be sued. So why is this different? Why is this allowed?”\\nAs concern grows about measles outbreaks in the US, the spotlight is increasingly falling on the closed anti-vaccination Facebook groups.

Twenty-four-pound bags of the powder cost $432.\\nRevitalize Wellness carries a disclaimer saying that its products are “not intended to treat, diagnose, cure or prevent disease”.

Otherwise, he said, the region could end up facing restrictions or possible lockdowns until Christmas.\\nHipkins said that the two infected people were co-operating with authorities but had not been scanning in using New Zealand’s location tracing app – a detail which may make contact tracing more difficult. Both are unvaccinated.\\nGiving a later update, the minister said that quarantine requirements for international arrivals would be eased next month.\\n“As vaccination rates have increased internationally, the number of Covid cases being picked up through our MIQ [managed isolation and quarantine] facilities has continued to decline. We now only get 2-3 cases per 1,000 arrivals and only around 1 in 2,000 is detected after seven days of isolation,” Hipkins said.\\nFrom 14 November, MIQ stays will be reduced from 14 days to seven, with travellers being tested on days zero, three and six. They will then isolate at home for short periods of around three days, and be tested again on day nine.\\nThis will likely free up about 1,500 rooms a month in MIQ, Hipkins said. Some of this will be taken up by community cases but some will go into the booking system for travellers from overseas.\\nOn 8 November, travellers from low-risk countries, starting with some Pacific islands, will be allowed to bypass MIQ altogether. Travellers will need to be fully vaccinated, unless they are New Zealand citizens.\\nIn the first quarter of 2022, increasing numbers of fully vaccinated international travellers will be able to skip quarantine and self-isolate. This step in the new MIQ regime will be dependent upon the country transitioning to its new traffic light system.\\nNew Zealand Covid: Māori party likens new ‘traffic light’ system to ‘Squid Game’\\nRead more\\nHipkins said: “My message to all New Zealanders, whether they’re here or abroad is a very, very simple one.

But some of the ones that are coming in internationally are all going to be double vaccinated.\\n“Our family is all double-vaxxed and coming from Brisbane, Australia, which is a very low risk area, and we will be getting whatever tests are required before we fly.

The WHO points to a 30% worldwide increase in measles, a highly contagious illness that can cause deafness, brain inflammation, pneumonia and death, especially in children.\\nLast month Washington state imposed a state of emergency after 48 people contracted measles. Most of those infected were unvaccinated and under 10 years old.\\nDr Noni MacDonald, a professor of pediatrics at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, who has worked as an expert adviser to the WHO on immunization, questioned why Facebook was unrestrained by the stringent controls against misinformation put on drug companies. “We don’t let big pharma or big food or big radio companies do this, so why should we let this happen in this venue?”\\nShe added: “When a drug company puts a drug up in the formal media, they can’t tell you something false or they will be sued.

Until they become safe and not driven by money I would avoid all vaccines.”\\nGironda is also listed as an administrator of a separate Facebook group called Vitamin C Against Vaccine Damage. She welcomes new approved members to the group with this statement: “Science and experience of mass amounts of people have proven that vaccines CAN damage the body … Vitamin C is the safest and most effective way to protect from damage for those that are mandated to be vaccinated.”\\nAfter the Guardian contacted Gironda, the status of the group Vitamin C Against Vaccine Damage was changed from closed to secret.

       "  'New Zealand’s South Island has recorded its first Covid cases in a major city in over a year, with two cases detected in Christchurch, as the government announced it will begin relaxing its strict international border settings.\\nCovid-19 response minister Chris Hipkins said at this stage there would be no snap lockdown for the city, the largest in the South Island, despite the fact one of the cases may have been infectious in the community for almost two weeks.\\n“This is a good reminder to people around the country that cases can pop up and this highlights the importance to get vaccinated,” Hipkins said.\\nBoth of Thursday’s new cases were members of the same household, and one had recently returned from Auckland.\\nNew Zealand announced 89 new cases of Covid-19 on Thursday, including the two in Christchurch. According to the Ministry of Health, 89% of eligible adults in Canterbury, of which Christchurch is the main city, had had at least one dose of the vaccine, and 67% had had both doses. The region would require almost 111,000 people to get both doses before hitting the 90% target set by the government, where most restrictions can be lifted. Across the country, 85% of the eligible population (those aged 12 and over) have had at least one dose of the vaccine, or 72% of the full population; 70% of the eligible population have had both doses, or 60% of the full population.\\nA catamaran and a plan: desperate to get home, New Zealanders set sail across the Tasman\\nRead more\\nEpidemiologist and public health prof Michael Baker said there needed to be stronger protections at the boundaries of the North and South Islands. “We may be seeding the whole South Island with cases right at the moment, because we’ve got increasing transmission in Auckland, and still people flying from Auckland all around the country – and we’ve got limited controls on that,” he said. Baker called for pre-departure testing, and for vaccine requirements on domestic flights.\\nDr Apisalome Talemaitoga, chair of the Pasifika GP network, said via the Science Media Centre, “I just find it unbelievable that we are allowing unvaccinated people out of Auckland to travel – for whatever reason. People should be doubly vaccinated before they can do this.”\\nWith the region still weeks away from 90% vaccination, Baker said there were “huge health and economic reasons for delaying widespread transmission in the South Island as long as possible”. Otherwise, he said, the region could end up facing restrictions or possible lockdowns until Christmas.\\nHipkins said that the two infected people were co-operating with authorities but had not been scanning in using New Zealand’s location tracing app – a detail which may make contact tracing more difficult. Both are unvaccinated.\\nGiving a later update, the minister said that quarantine requirements for international arrivals would be eased next month.\\n“As vaccination rates have increased internationally, the number of Covid cases being picked up through our MIQ [managed isolation and quarantine] facilities has continued to decline. We now only get 2-3 cases per 1,000 arrivals and only around 1 in 2,000 is detected after seven days of isolation,” Hipkins said.\\nFrom 14 November, MIQ stays will be reduced from 14 days to seven, with travellers being tested on days zero, three and six. They will then isolate at home for short periods of around three days, and be tested again on day nine.\\nThis will likely free up about 1,500 rooms a month in MIQ, Hipkins said. Some of this will be taken up by community cases but some will go into the booking system for travellers from overseas.\\nOn 8 November, travellers from low-risk countries, starting with some Pacific islands, will be allowed to bypass MIQ altogether. Travellers will need to be fully vaccinated, unless they are New Zealand citizens.\\nIn the first quarter of 2022, increasing numbers of fully vaccinated international travellers will be able to skip quarantine and self-isolate. This step in the new MIQ regime will be dependent upon the country transitioning to its new traffic light system.\\nNew Zealand Covid: Māori party likens new ‘traffic light’ system to ‘Squid Game’\\nRead more\\nHipkins said: “My message to all New Zealanders, whether they’re here or abroad is a very, very simple one. Get vaccinated. Then we can all get back to doing the things that we love and to seeing the people that we love.”\\nBut New Zealanders stranded overseas and desperate to get home are feeling dissatisfied with the announcement.\\nRikki Sands, a New Zealand citizen based in Brisbane, has entered the MIQ lottery 4 times without success. Sands, who is a specialised mechanical and hydraulic engineer, his wife and two daughters have been planning to come home since the beginning of the year.\\n“I’ve got more chance of winning lotto than an MIQ spot at the moment,” Sands said.\\nHe said the freeing up of 1,500 more MIQ spots was negligible, and did not give him any confidence he would get home sooner.\\nAnd he believes the justifications are unfair. “They said that the reason they can’t open the borders is because the local people aren’t getting vaccinated. But some of the ones that are coming in internationally are all going to be double vaccinated.\\n“Our family is all double-vaxxed and coming from Brisbane, Australia, which is a very low risk area, and we will be getting whatever tests are required before we fly.

       "  'New Zealand’s South Island has recorded its first Covid cases in a major city in over a year, with two cases detected in Christchurch, as the government announced it will begin relaxing its strict international border settings.\\nCovid-19 response minister Chris Hipkins said at this stage there would be no snap lockdown for the city, the largest in the South Island, despite the fact one of the cases may have been infectious in the community for almost two weeks.\\n“This is a good reminder to people around the country that cases can pop up and this highlights the importance to get vaccinated,” Hipkins said.\\nBoth of Thursday’s new cases were members of the same household, and one had recently returned from Auckland.\\nNew Zealand announced 89 new cases of Covid-19 on Thursday, including the two in Christchurch. According to the Ministry of Health, 89% of eligible adults in Canterbury, of which Christchurch is the main city, had had at least one dose of the vaccine, and 67% had had both doses. The region would require almost 111,000 people to get both doses before hitting the 90% target set by the government, where most restrictions can be lifted. Across the country, 85% of the eligible population (those aged 12 and over) have had at least one dose of the vaccine, or 72% of the full population; 70% of the eligible population have had both doses, or 60% of the full population.\\nA catamaran and a plan: desperate to get home, New Zealanders set sail across the Tasman\\nRead more\\nEpidemiologist and public health prof Michael Baker said there needed to be stronger protections at the boundaries of the North and South Islands. “We may be seeding the whole South Island with cases right at the moment, because we’ve got increasing transmission in Auckland, and still people flying from Auckland all around the country – and we’ve got limited controls on that,” he said. Baker called for pre-departure testing, and for vaccine requirements on domestic flights.\\nDr Apisalome Talemaitoga, chair of the Pasifika GP network, said via the Science Media Centre, “I just find it unbelievable that we are allowing unvaccinated people out of Auckland to travel – for whatever reason. People should be doubly vaccinated before they can do this.”\\nWith the region still weeks away from 90% vaccination, Baker said there were “huge health and economic reasons for delaying widespread transmission in the South Island as long as possible”. Otherwise, he said, the region could end up facing restrictions or possible lockdowns until Christmas.\\nHipkins said that the two infected people were co-operating with authorities but had not been scanning in using New Zealand’s location tracing app – a detail which may make contact tracing more difficult. Both are unvaccinated.\\nGiving a later update, the minister said that quarantine requirements for international arrivals would be eased next month.\\n“As vaccination rates have increased internationally, the number of Covid cases being picked up through our MIQ [managed isolation and quarantine] facilities has continued to decline. We now only get 2-3 cases per 1,000 arrivals and only around 1 in 2,000 is detected after seven days of isolation,” Hipkins said.\\nFrom 14 November, MIQ stays will be reduced from 14 days to seven, with travellers being tested on days zero, three and six. They will then isolate at home for short periods of around three days, and be tested again on day nine.\\nThis will likely free up about 1,500 rooms a month in MIQ, Hipkins said. Some of this will be taken up by community cases but some will go into the booking system for travellers from overseas.\\nOn 8 November, travellers from low-risk countries, starting with some Pacific islands, will be allowed to bypass MIQ altogether. Travellers will need to be fully vaccinated, unless they are New Zealand citizens.\\nIn the first quarter of 2022, increasing numbers of fully vaccinated international travellers will be able to skip quarantine and self-isolate. This step in the new MIQ regime will be dependent upon the country transitioning to its new traffic light system.\\nNew Zealand Covid: Māori party likens new ‘traffic light’ system to ‘Squid Game’\\nRead more\\nHipkins said: “My message to all New Zealanders, whether they’re here or abroad is a very, very simple one. Get vaccinated. Then we can all get back to doing the things that we love and to seeing the people that we love.”\\nBut New Zealanders stranded overseas and desperate to get home are feeling dissatisfied with the announcement.\\nRikki Sands, a New Zealand citizen based in Brisbane, has entered the MIQ lottery 4 times without success. Sands, who is a specialised mechanical and hydraulic engineer, his wife and two daughters have been planning to come home since the beginning of the year.\\n“I’ve got more chance of winning lotto than an MIQ spot at the moment,” Sands said.\\nHe said the freeing up of 1,500 more MIQ spots was negligible, and did not give him any confidence he would get home sooner.\\nAnd he believes the justifications are unfair. “They said that the reason they can’t open the borders is because the local people aren’t getting vaccinated. But some of the ones that are coming in internationally are all going to be double vaccinated.\\n“Our family is all double-vaxxed and coming from Brisbane, Australia, which is a very low risk area, and we will be getting whatever tests are required before we fly. We just want to get home to our whānau [family].”',\n",

Stop Mandatory Vaccination has more than 150,000 approved members. Vitamin C Against Vaccine Damage claims that large doses of the vitamin can “heal” people from vaccine damage, even though vaccines are safe.\\nHealth experts are calling on Facebook to do more to counter these echo chambers. Dr Wendy Sue Swanson, spokeswoman of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said: “Facebook should prioritise dealing with the threat to human health when falsehoods and misinformation are shared. This isn’t just self-harm, it’s community harm.”\\nSwanson recently met with Facebook strategists and raised her concerns. “Parents deserve the truth. If they are being served up something that is not true it will likely increase their levels of anxiety and fear and potentially change their uptake of vaccines, which is dangerous,” she said.\\nFiona O’Leary, an autism activist and campaigner against pseudo-science, called on Facebook to block anti-vaccine groups. “If they won’t shut down closed groups I’d like to see a Facebook watchdog that will remove misinformation causing harm to children,” she said.\\nThe threat posed by the Facebook groups was put in stark relief by the World Health Organization (WHO), which lists “vaccine hesitancy” – reluctance to vaccinate – as one of the top 10 global health threats in 2019. The WHO points to a 30% worldwide increase in measles, a highly contagious illness that can cause deafness, brain inflammation, pneumonia and death, especially in children.\\nLast month Washington state imposed a state of emergency after 48 people contracted measles. Most of those infected were unvaccinated and under 10 years old.\\nDr Noni MacDonald, a professor of pediatrics at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, who has worked as an expert adviser to the WHO on immunization, questioned why Facebook was unrestrained by the stringent controls against misinformation put on drug companies. “We don’t let big pharma or big food or big radio companies do this, so why should we let this happen in this venue?”\\nShe added: “When a drug company puts a drug up in the formal media, they can’t tell you something false or they will be sued. So why is this different? Why is this allowed?”\\nAs concern grows about measles outbreaks in the US, the spotlight is increasingly falling on the closed anti-vaccination Facebook groups.

Twenty-four-pound bags of the powder cost $432.\\nRevitalize Wellness carries a disclaimer saying that its products are “not intended to treat, diagnose, cure or prevent disease”.

Otherwise, he said, the region could end up facing restrictions or possible lockdowns until Christmas.\\nHipkins said that the two infected people were co-operating with authorities but had not been scanning in using New Zealand’s location tracing app – a detail which may make contact tracing more difficult. Both are unvaccinated.\\nGiving a later update, the minister said that quarantine requirements for international arrivals would be eased next month.\\n“As vaccination rates have increased internationally, the number of Covid cases being picked up through our MIQ [managed isolation and quarantine] facilities has continued to decline. We now only get 2-3 cases per 1,000 arrivals and only around 1 in 2,000 is detected after seven days of isolation,” Hipkins said.\\nFrom 14 November, MIQ stays will be reduced from 14 days to seven, with travellers being tested on days zero, three and six. They will then isolate at home for short periods of around three days, and be tested again on day nine.\\nThis will likely free up about 1,500 rooms a month in MIQ, Hipkins said. Some of this will be taken up by community cases but some will go into the booking system for travellers from overseas.\\nOn 8 November, travellers from low-risk countries, starting with some Pacific islands, will be allowed to bypass MIQ altogether. Travellers will need to be fully vaccinated, unless they are New Zealand citizens.\\nIn the first quarter of 2022, increasing numbers of fully vaccinated international travellers will be able to skip quarantine and self-isolate. This step in the new MIQ regime will be dependent upon the country transitioning to its new traffic light system.\\nNew Zealand Covid: Māori party likens new ‘traffic light’ system to ‘Squid Game’\\nRead more\\nHipkins said: “My message to all New Zealanders, whether they’re here or abroad is a very, very simple one.

But some of the ones that are coming in internationally are all going to be double vaccinated.\\n“Our family is all double-vaxxed and coming from Brisbane, Australia, which is a very low risk area, and we will be getting whatever tests are required before we fly.

The WHO points to a 30% worldwide increase in measles, a highly contagious illness that can cause deafness, brain inflammation, pneumonia and death, especially in children.\\nLast month Washington state imposed a state of emergency after 48 people contracted measles. Most of those infected were unvaccinated and under 10 years old.\\nDr Noni MacDonald, a professor of pediatrics at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, who has worked as an expert adviser to the WHO on immunization, questioned why Facebook was unrestrained by the stringent controls against misinformation put on drug companies. “We don’t let big pharma or big food or big radio companies do this, so why should we let this happen in this venue?”\\nShe added: “When a drug company puts a drug up in the formal media, they can’t tell you something false or they will be sued.

Until they become safe and not driven by money I would avoid all vaccines.”\\nGironda is also listed as an administrator of a separate Facebook group called Vitamin C Against Vaccine Damage. She welcomes new approved members to the group with this statement: “Science and experience of mass amounts of people have proven that vaccines CAN damage the body … Vitamin C is the safest and most effective way to protect from damage for those that are mandated to be vaccinated.”\\nAfter the Guardian contacted Gironda, the status of the group Vitamin C Against Vaccine Damage was changed from closed to secret.

Most of those infected were unvaccinated and under 10 years old.\\nDr Noni MacDonald, a professor of pediatrics at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, who has worked as an expert adviser to the WHO on immunization, questioned why Facebook was unrestrained by the stringent controls against misinformation put on drug companies. “We don’t let big pharma or big food or big radio companies do this, so why should we let this happen in this venue?”\\nShe added: “When a drug company puts a drug up in the formal media, they can’t tell you something false or they will be sued. So why is this different? Why is this allowed?”\\nAs concern grows about measles outbreaks in the US, the spotlight is increasingly falling on the closed anti-vaccination Facebook groups. The Guardian gained access to some of the groups, finding them to be rife with pseudo-science.\\nFacebook autofill suggestions for ‘vacci’. Photograph: Facebook\\nOne group, Vitamin C & Orthomolecular Medicine for Optimal Health, tells its users that it is “not an anti-vax group”. Its leader, Katie Gironda, says: “This group needs to remain neutral on the vaccine topic.”\\nYet anyone allowed into this closed group of about 49,000 approved members will find ample material questioning the safety of vaccines. They will also find recommendations for alternative remedies that are falsely claimed to protect against disease.\\nGironda is listed on LinkedIn as CEO of an online business in Colorado selling high-dose vitamin C. Members of her closed group are encouraged to “shop now” – in one click they are linked directly to her firm, Revitalize Wellness.\\nThe site sells vitamin C powder in bulk, with customers encouraged to give children aged two up to three grams a day whereas the recommended daily intake is 15mg. Twenty-four-pound bags of the powder cost $432.\\nRevitalize Wellness carries a disclaimer saying that its products are “not intended to treat, diagnose, cure or prevent disease”. But in conversation with members of her closed Facebook group, Gironda gives the opposite advice.\\n“Vitamin C has an amazing record of fighting the same diseases vaccines were made for,” she posts.\\nIn another entry she says: “I think the cons outweigh the pros on vaccines … Through greed they became a weapon. Until they become safe and not driven by money I would avoid all vaccines.”\\nGironda is also listed as an administrator of a separate Facebook group called Vitamin C Against Vaccine Damage. She welcomes new approved members to the group with this statement: “Science and experience of mass amounts of people have proven that vaccines CAN damage the body … Vitamin C is the safest and most effective way to protect from damage for those that are mandated to be vaccinated.”\\nAfter the Guardian contacted Gironda, the status of the group Vitamin C Against Vaccine Damage was changed from closed to secret. That put it into an even more heavily shrouded category that hides the group entirely from the view of non-members by taking it out of Facebook searches.\\nFacebook has a moral responsibility to do something – this misinformation has the potential to kill children\\nDavid Robert Grimes\\nIn discussions on the closed groups, members frequently express incorrect information that is reinforced by their peers. In January a woman posted that she lived “near this big measles outbreak”. She asked fellow members: “What should I be upping for my kids to keep them better protected?”\\nAnother member gave this advice: “Load up on vitamin A. Measles susceptibility skyrockets among people with low vitamin A.”\\nIn December a mother in Canada wrote to one of the groups, describing herself as a “first time mom with a 6 month old daughter who is completely vax free. My daughter is sick, I’m so upset and worried. I have always felt confident in my decision to not vax but I’m worried about what she may have contacted [sic].”\\nA fellow member wrote back: “Baby needs a vitamin C IV.”\\nDavid Robert Grimes, a physicist who specializes in countering fake science, said vitamin C would “absolutely not” protect against measles. “Vitamin C does nothing for immunization.”\\nGrimes said that he had repeatedly reported anti-vaccination groups to Facebook, with no result. “Facebook has a moral responsibility to do something – this misinformation has the potential to kill children.”\\nThe Guardian put it to Gironda that misinformation about vaccines can put children’s lives at risk and that vitamin C was not an effective alternative. In an email she said: “Revitalize Wellness maintains a neutral stance on vaccines. We make every effort to uphold that neutral stance in our Facebook group.”\\nShe said that she was a follower of “vitamin C pioneers”, citing Dr Linus Pauling, Dr Frederick Klenner, Dr Robert F Cathcart, Dr Irwin Stone and Dr Thomas Levy. She added: “There will always be controversy on the efficacy of vitamin C.”\\nMeasles was declared eliminated in the US authorities in 2000 thanks to the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR). But since then the fraudulent exploits of the discredited British doctor Andrew Wakefield has sown doubts in the minds of many parents about a link between MMR and autism – despite numerous studies that have debunked the connection.\\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has warned there are now about 100,000 American children under two years old who are completely unvaccinated – a fourfold increase on 2001.\\nMeasles outbreak sparks concerns over anti-vaccination movement\\nRead more\\nParadoxically, pressure on Facebook to scrub its platform of inaccurate information comes as the company’s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, and his wife, Priscilla Chan, are actively funding a $3bn effort to “cure all diseases”. Part of this effort is work to develop vaccine technologies through the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub.\\nFacebook is increasingly engaged in combatting misinformation that causes “real-world harm”. Yet despite the health risks, anti-vaccination propaganda is currently not treated as a breach of its content rules.\\nThe Guardian asked Facebook to respond to the proliferation of vaccine misinformation on its platform, but the company did not reply.\\nIn addition to hosting many closed anti-vaccination groups, Facebook has taken in thousands of advertising dollars from those who specifically target parents with often frightening false messages meant to undermine trust in vaccines. Stop Mandatory Vaccination promoted an ad so extreme it was censored by the UK’s Advertising Standards Authority (ASA).\\nThe group later told the ASA, according to the association’s account of proceedings, that it “targeted users with an interest in parenting”, with the intent to “cause parents some concern before choosing to vaccinate their children”.\\nFacebook also accepted advertising revenue from Vax Truther, Anti-Vaxxer, Vaccines Revealed and Michigan for Vaccine Choice, among others.\\nAfter publication, Facebook supplied a statement to the Guardian. A spokesperson said: “We have a set of Community Standards that outline what is and isn’t allowed on Facebook. While we work hard to remove content that violates our policies, we also give our community tools to control what they see as well as use Facebook to speak up and share perspectives with the community around them. If the content they’re posting crosses the line and violates our policies, we would remove the content as soon as we become aware of it.”\\nThis article was amended on 15 February 2019 to clarify Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan’s $3bn effort to “cure all diseases”.',\n",

       "  'New Zealand’s South Island has recorded its first Covid cases in a major city in over a year, with two cases detected in Christchurch, as the government announced it will begin relaxing its strict international border settings.\\nCovid-19 response minister Chris Hipkins said at this stage there would be no snap lockdown for the city, the largest in the South Island, despite the fact one of the cases may have been infectious in the community for almost two weeks.\\n“This is a good reminder to people around the country that cases can pop up and this highlights the importance to get vaccinated,” Hipkins said.\\nBoth of Thursday’s new cases were members of the same household, and one had recently returned from Auckland.\\nNew Zealand announced 89 new cases of Covid-19 on Thursday, including the two in Christchurch. According to the Ministry of Health, 89% of eligible adults in Canterbury, of which Christchurch is the main city, had had at least one dose of the vaccine, and 67% had had both doses. The region would require almost 111,000 people to get both doses before hitting the 90% target set by the government, where most restrictions can be lifted. Across the country, 85% of the eligible population (those aged 12 and over) have had at least one dose of the vaccine, or 72% of the full population; 70% of the eligible population have had both doses, or 60% of the full population.\\nA catamaran and a plan: desperate to get home, New Zealanders set sail across the Tasman\\nRead more\\nEpidemiologist and public health prof Michael Baker said there needed to be stronger protections at the boundaries of the North and South Islands. “We may be seeding the whole South Island with cases right at the moment, because we’ve got increasing transmission in Auckland, and still people flying from Auckland all around the country – and we’ve got limited controls on that,” he said. Baker called for pre-departure testing, and for vaccine requirements on domestic flights.\\nDr Apisalome Talemaitoga, chair of the Pasifika GP network, said via the Science Media Centre, “I just find it unbelievable that we are allowing unvaccinated people out of Auckland to travel – for whatever reason. People should be doubly vaccinated before they can do this.”\\nWith the region still weeks away from 90% vaccination, Baker said there were “huge health and economic reasons for delaying widespread transmission in the South Island as long as possible”. Otherwise, he said, the region could end up facing restrictions or possible lockdowns until Christmas.\\nHipkins said that the two infected people were co-operating with authorities but had not been scanning in using New Zealand’s location tracing app – a detail which may make contact tracing more difficult. Both are unvaccinated.\\nGiving a later update, the minister said that quarantine requirements for international arrivals would be eased next month.\\n“As vaccination rates have increased internationally, the number of Covid cases being picked up through our MIQ [managed isolation and quarantine] facilities has continued to decline. We now only get 2-3 cases per 1,000 arrivals and only around 1 in 2,000 is detected after seven days of isolation,” Hipkins said.\\nFrom 14 November, MIQ stays will be reduced from 14 days to seven, with travellers being tested on days zero, three and six. They will then isolate at home for short periods of around three days, and be tested again on day nine.\\nThis will likely free up about 1,500 rooms a month in MIQ, Hipkins said. Some of this will be taken up by community cases but some will go into the booking system for travellers from overseas.\\nOn 8 November, travellers from low-risk countries, starting with some Pacific islands, will be allowed to bypass MIQ altogether. Travellers will need to be fully vaccinated, unless they are New Zealand citizens.\\nIn the first quarter of 2022, increasing numbers of fully vaccinated international travellers will be able to skip quarantine and self-isolate. This step in the new MIQ regime will be dependent upon the country transitioning to its new traffic light system.\\nNew Zealand Covid: Māori party likens new ‘traffic light’ system to ‘Squid Game’\\nRead more\\nHipkins said: “My message to all New Zealanders, whether they’re here or abroad is a very, very simple one. Get vaccinated. Then we can all get back to doing the things that we love and to seeing the people that we love.”\\nBut New Zealanders stranded overseas and desperate to get home are feeling dissatisfied with the announcement.\\nRikki Sands, a New Zealand citizen based in Brisbane, has entered the MIQ lottery 4 times without success. Sands, who is a specialised mechanical and hydraulic engineer, his wife and two daughters have been planning to come home since the beginning of the year.\\n“I’ve got more chance of winning lotto than an MIQ spot at the moment,” Sands said.\\nHe said the freeing up of 1,500 more MIQ spots was negligible, and did not give him any confidence he would get home sooner.\\nAnd he believes the justifications are unfair. “They said that the reason they can’t open the borders is because the local people aren’t getting vaccinated. But some of the ones that are coming in internationally are all going to be double vaccinated.\\n“Our family is all double-vaxxed and coming from Brisbane, Australia, which is a very low risk area, and we will be getting whatever tests are required before we fly. We just want to get home to our whānau [family].”',\n",
